      "‘Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family \n",
      "estates of the Buonapartes . But I warn you, if you don’t \n",
      "tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the \n",
      "infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist - I \n",
      "really believe he is Antichri st - I will have nothing more \n",
      "to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer \n",
      "my ‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself! But how do you \n",
      "do? I see I have frightened you - sit down and tell me all \n",
      "the news.’ \n",
      "It was in July, 1805, and th e speaker was the well-\n",
      "known Anna Pavlovna Schere r, maid of honor and \n",
      "favorite of the Empress Ma rya Fedorovna. With these \n",
      "words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high \n",
      "rank and importance, who was th e first to arrive at her \n",
      "reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. \n",
      "She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe \n",
      "being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the \n",
      "elite. \n",
      "All her invitations without  exception, written in \n",
      "French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that \n",
      "morning, ran as follows: \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "4 of 2882 \n",
      "‘If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], \n",
      "and if the prospect of spe nding an evening with a poor \n",
      "invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see \n",
      "you tonight between 7 and 10- Annette Scherer.’ \n",
      "‘Heavens! what a virulent attack!’ replied the prince, \n",
      "not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just \n",
      "entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee \n",
      "breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a \n",
      "serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined \n",
      "French in which our grandf athers not only spoke but \n",
      "thought, and with the gentle , patronizing intonation \n",
      "natural to a man of importa nce who had grown old in \n",
      "society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed \n",
      "her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining \n",
      "head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa. \n",
      "‘First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your \n",
      "friend’s mind at rest,’ said he  without altering his tone, \n",
      "beneath the politeness and a ffected sympathy of which \n",
      "indifference and even irony could be discerned. \n",
      "‘Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be \n",
      "calm in times like these if one has any feeling?’ said Anna \n",
      "Pavlovna. ‘You are staying the whole evening, I hope?’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "5 of 2882 \n",
      "‘And the fete at the Eng lish ambassador’s? Today is \n",
      "Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,’ said the \n",
      "prince. ‘My daughter is coming for me to take me there.’ \n",
      "‘I thought today’s fete had been canceled. I confess all \n",
      "these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.’ \n",
      "‘If they had known that you wished it, the \n",
      "entertainment would have been put off,’ said the prince, \n",
      "who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things \n",
      "he did not even wish to be believed. \n",
      "‘Don’t tease! Well, and what  has been decided about \n",
      "Novosiltsev’s dispatch? You know everything.’ \n",
      "‘What can one say about it?’ replied the prince in a \n",
      "cold, listless tone. ‘What has been decided? They have \n",
      "decided that Buonaparte has bu rnt his boats, and I believe \n",
      "that we are ready to burn ours.’ \n",
      "Prince Vasili always spoke  languidly, like an actor \n",
      "repeating a stale part. A nna Pavlovna Scherer on the \n",
      "contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with \n",
      "animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had \n",
      "become her social vocation and, sometimes even when \n",
      "she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order \n",
      "not to disappoint the expecta tions of those who knew her. \n",
      "The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded \n",
      "features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a War and Peace  \n",
      "6 of 2882 \n",
      "spoiled child, a continual c onsciousness of her charming \n",
      "defect, which she neither  wished, nor could, nor \n",
      "considered it necessary, to correct. \n",
      "In the midst of a conversa tion on political matters \n",
      "Anna Pavlovna burst out: \n",
      "‘Oh, don’t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don’t \n",
      "understand things, but Austria never has wished, and does \n",
      "not wish, for war. She is be traying us! Russia alone must \n",
      "save Europe. Our gracious s overeign recognizes his high \n",
      "vocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have \n",
      "faith in! Our good and wonde rful sovereign has to \n",
      "perform the noblest role on ear th, and he is so virtuous \n",
      "and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his \n",
      "vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has \n",
      "become more terrible than ever in the person of this \n",
      "murderer and villain! We al one must avenge the blood of \n",
      "the just one.... Whom, I as k you, can we rely on?... \n",
      "England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot \n",
      "understand the Emperor Alexander’s loftiness of soul. She \n",
      "has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and \n",
      "still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What \n",
      "answer did Novosiltsev get? None. The English have not \n",
      "understood and cannot understand  the self-abnegation of \n",
      "our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "7 of 2882 \n",
      "desires the good of mankind. And what have they \n",
      "promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised \n",
      "they will not perform! Prussia has always declared that \n",
      "Buonaparte is invincible, and th at all Europe is powerless \n",
      "before him.... And I don’t believe a word that Hardenburg \n",
      "says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality \n",
      "is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny \n",
      "of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!’ \n",
      "She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity. \n",
      "‘I think,’ said the prince with a smile, ‘that if you had \n",
      "been sent instead of our d ear Wintzingerode you would \n",
      "have captured the King of Prussia’s consent by assault. \n",
      "You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?’ \n",
      "‘In a moment. A propos,’ she added, becoming calm \n",
      "again, ‘I am expecting two very  interesting men tonight, \n",
      "le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is connected with the \n",
      "Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best \n",
      "French families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the \n",
      "good ones. And also the Abbe Morio. Do you know that \n",
      "profound thinker? He has been  received by the Emperor. \n",
      "Had you heard?’ \n",
      "‘I shall be delighted to meet them,’ said the prince. \n",
      "‘But tell me,’ he added with studied carelessness as if it \n",
      "had only just occurred to him, though the question he was War and Peace  \n",
      "8 of 2882 \n",
      "about to ask was the chief motiv e of his visit, ‘is it true \n",
      "that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be \n",
      "appointed first secretary at  Vienna? The baron by all \n",
      "accounts is a poor creature.’ \n",
      "Prince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but \n",
      "others were trying through the Dowager Empress Marya \n",
      "Fedorovna to secure it for the baron. \n",
      "Anna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that \n",
      "neither she nor anyone else ha d a right to criticize what \n",
      "the Empress desired or was pleased with. \n",
      "‘Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager \n",
      "Empress by her sister,’ was all she said, in a dry and \n",
      "mournful tone. \n",
      "As she named the Empress, Anna Pavlovna’s face \n",
      "suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere \n",
      "devotion and respect mingled  with sadness, and this \n",
      "occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious \n",
      "patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to \n",
      "show Baron Funke beaucoup d’estime, and again her face \n",
      "clouded over with sadness. \n",
      "The prince was silent and l ooked indifferent. But, with \n",
      "the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual \n",
      "to her, Anna Pavlovna wish ed both to rebuke him (for \n",
      "daring to speak he had done of a man recommended to the \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "9 of 2882 \n",
      "Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she \n",
      "said: \n",
      "‘Now about your family. Do you know that since your \n",
      "daughter came out everyone ha s been enraptured by her? \n",
      "They say she is amazingly beautiful.’ \n",
      "The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude. \n",
      "‘I often think,’ she conti nued after a short pause, \n",
      "drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him \n",
      "as if to show that political and social topics were ended \n",
      "and the time had come for intimate conversation- ‘I often \n",
      "think how unfairly sometimes  the joys of life are \n",
      "distributed. Why has fate gi ven you two such splendid \n",
      "children? I don’t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don’t \n",
      "like him,’ she added in a tone  admitting of no rejoinder \n",
      "and raising her eyebrows. ‘T wo such charming children. \n",
      "And really you appreciate them  less than anyone, and so \n",
      "you don’t deserve to have them.’ \n",
      "And she smiled her ecstatic smile. \n",
      "‘I can’t help it,’ said the prince. ‘Lavater would have \n",
      "said I lack the bump of paternity.’ \n",
      "‘Don’t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do \n",
      "you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son? \n",
      "Between ourselves’ (and her face assumed its melancholy War and Peace  \n",
      "10 of 2882 \n",
      "expression), ‘he was mentioned at Her Majesty’s and you \n",
      "were pitied...’ \n",
      "The prince answered nothi ng, but she looked at him \n",
      "significantly, awaiting a reply. He frowned. \n",
      "‘What would you have me do?’ he said at last. ‘You \n",
      "know I did all a father could for their education, and they \n",
      "have both turned out fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet \n",
      "fool, but Anatole is an ac tive one. That is the only \n",
      "difference between them.’ He said this smiling in a way \n",
      "more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles \n",
      "round his mouth very clea rly revealed something \n",
      "unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant. \n",
      "‘And why are children born to such men as you? If you \n",
      "were not a father there woul d be nothing I could reproach \n",
      "you with,’ said Anna Pavlovna, looking up pensively. \n",
      "‘I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess \n",
      "that my children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I \n",
      "have to bear. That is how I explain it to myself. It can’t be \n",
      "helped!’ \n",
      "He said no more, but expre ssed his resignation to cruel \n",
      "fate by a gesture. Anna Pavlovna meditated. \n",
      "‘Have you never thought of  marrying your prodigal \n",
      "son Anatole?’ she asked. ‘T hey say old maids have a \n",
      "mania for matchmaking, and though I don’t feel that \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "11 of 2882 \n",
      "weakness in myself as yet,I know a little person who is \n",
      "very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, \n",
      "Princess Mary Bolkonskaya.’ \n",
      "Prince Vasili did not reply, though, with the quickness \n",
      "of memory and perception befitting a man of the world, \n",
      "he indicated by a movement of the head that he was \n",
      "considering this information. \n",
      "‘Do you know,’ he said at last, evidently unable to \n",
      "check the sad current of hi s thoughts, ‘that Anatole is \n",
      "costing me forty thousand rubl es a year? And,’ he went \n",
      "on after a pause, ‘what will it be in five years, if he goes \n",
      "on like this?’ Presently he added: ‘That’s what we fathers \n",
      "have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?’ \n",
      "‘Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the \n",
      "country. He is the well-know n Prince Bolkonski who had \n",
      "to retire from the army under the late Emperor, and was \n",
      "nicknamed ‘the King of Prussi a.’ He is very clever but \n",
      "eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. She \n",
      "has a brother; I think you know  him, he married Lise \n",
      "Meinen lately. He is an aide-de-camp of Kutuzov’s and \n",
      "will be here tonight.’ \n",
      "‘Listen, dear Annette,’ said the prince, suddenly taking \n",
      "Anna Pavlovna’s hand and for some reason drawing it \n",
      "downwards. ‘Arrange that affair for me and I shall always War and Peace  \n",
      "12 of 2882 \n",
      "be your most devoted slave- slafe wigh an f, as a village \n",
      "elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich and of good \n",
      "family and that’s all I want.’ \n",
      "And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to \n",
      "him, he raised the maid of honor’s hand to his lips, kissed \n",
      "it, and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair, \n",
      "looking in another direction. \n",
      "‘Attendez,’ said Anna Pavlovna, reflecting, ‘I’ll speak \n",
      "to Lise, young Bolkonski’s wife, this very evening, and \n",
      "perhaps the thing can be a rranged. It shall be on your \n",
      "family’s behalf that I’ll st art my apprenticeship as old \n",
      "maid.’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "13 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter II \n",
      "Anna Pavlovna’s drawing room was gradually filling. \n",
      "The highest Petersburg society was assembled there: \n",
      "people differing widely in age and character but alike in \n",
      "the social circle to which they belonged. Prince Vasili’s \n",
      "daughter, the beautiful Helene, came to take her father to \n",
      "the ambassador’s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and \n",
      "her badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess \n",
      "Bolkonskaya, known as la femme la plus seduisante de \n",
      "Petersbourg,* was also there. She had been married \n",
      "during the previous winter, a nd being pregnant did not go \n",
      "to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions. \n",
      "Prince Vasili’s son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, \n",
      "whom he introduced. The Abbe Morio and many others \n",
      "had also come. \n",
      "*The most fascinating woman in Petersburg. \n",
      "To each new arrival Anna Pavlovna said, ‘You have \n",
      "not yet seen my aunt,’ or ‘You do not know my aunt?’ \n",
      "and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady, \n",
      "wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come \n",
      "sailing in from another room  as soon as the guests began \n",
      "to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to War and Peace  \n",
      "14 of 2882 \n",
      "her aunt, Anna Pavlovna mentioned each one’s name and \n",
      "then left them. \n",
      "Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this \n",
      "old aunt whom not one of th em knew, not one of them \n",
      "wanted to know, and not one of them cared about; Anna \n",
      "Pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and \n",
      "solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to \n",
      "each of them in the same words, about their health and her \n",
      "own, and the health of Her Majesty, ‘who, thank God, \n",
      "was better today.’ And each visitor, though politeness \n",
      "prevented his showing impatie nce, left the old woman \n",
      "with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious \n",
      "duty and did not return to her the whole evening. \n",
      "The young Princess Bolkonska ya had brought some \n",
      "work in a gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little \n",
      "upper lip, on which a delicate dark down was just \n",
      "perceptible, was too short for he r teeth, but it lifted all the \n",
      "more sweetly, and was especially charming when she \n",
      "occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is \n",
      "always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her \n",
      "defect- the shortnes s of her upper lip and her half-open \n",
      "mouth- seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of \n",
      "beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty \n",
      "young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "15 of 2882 \n",
      "and health, and carrying her burden so lightly. Old men \n",
      "and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her, after \n",
      "being in her company and talking to her a little while, felt \n",
      "as if they too were becomi ng, like her, full of life and \n",
      "health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw her \n",
      "bright smile and the constant  gleam of her white teeth, \n",
      "thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that \n",
      "day. \n",
      "The little princess went round the table with quick, \n",
      "short, swaying steps, her wo rkbag on her arm, and gaily \n",
      "spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver \n",
      "samovar, as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself \n",
      "and to all around her. ‘I have brought my work,’ said she \n",
      "in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present. \n",
      "‘Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked \n",
      "trick on me,’ she added, turning to her hostess. ‘You \n",
      "wrote that it was to be quite a small reception, and just see \n",
      "how badly I am dressed.’ And she spread out her arms to \n",
      "show her short-waiste d, lace-trimmed, da inty gray dress, \n",
      "girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast. \n",
      "‘Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier \n",
      "than anyone else,’ replied Anna Pavlovna. \n",
      "‘You know,’ said the princes s in the same tone of \n",
      "voice and still in French, tu rning to a general, ‘my \n",

      "16 of 2882 \n",
      "husband is deserting me? He is going to get himself \n",
      "killed. Tell me what this wret ched war is for?’ she added, \n",
      "addressing Prince Vasili, and without waiting for an \n",
      "answer she turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful \n",
      "Helene. \n",
      "‘What a delightful woman this little princess is!’ said \n",
      "Prince Vasili to Anna Pavlovna. \n",
      "One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built \n",
      "young man with close-cropped ha ir, spectacles, the light-\n",
      "colored breeches fashionable at that time, a very high \n",
      "ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout young man was \n",
      "an illegitimate son of Count Bezukhov, a well-known \n",
      "grandee of Catherine’s time who now lay dying in \n",
      "Moscow. The young man had not yet entered either the \n",
      "military or civil service, as he had only just returned from \n",

      "a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight of something too \n",
      "large and unsuited to the place, came over her face when \n",
      "she saw Pierre enter. Though he was certainly rather \n",
      "bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety could \n",

      "alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her. \n",
      "Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and \n",
      "continued to look round as if in search of something. On \n",
      "his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a \n",
      "pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance. \n",
      "Anna Pavlovna’s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned \n",
      "away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech \n",
      "about Her Majesty’ s health. Anna Pavlovna in dismay \n",
      "detained him with the words: ‘Do you know the Abbe \n",

      "‘Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, \n",
      "and it is very interesting but hardly feasible.’ \n",
      "‘You think so?’ rejoined Anna Pavlovna in order to say \n",
      "something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess. \n",
      "But Pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness. \n",
      "First he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to \n",
      "him, and now he continued to speak to another who \n",
      "wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet \n",
      "spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking \n",

      "18 of 2882 \n",
      "‘We will talk of it later,’ said Anna Pavlovna with a \n",

      "and continued to listen and wa tch, ready to help at any \n",

      "conversational machine in steady, proper, and regular \n",

      "With the exception of the aunt, beside whom sat only one \n",
      "elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face was rather \n",
      "out of place in this brillian t society, the whole company \n",

      "very pretty and rosy, though ra ther too plump for her age. \n",
      "The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna \n",
      "Pavlovna. \n",
      "The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft \n",

      "himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed \n",
      "himself at the disposal of th e circle in which he found \n",
      "himself. Anna Pavlovna was obviously serving him up as \n",

      "as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one \n",
      "who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat, so \n",
      "Anna Pavlovna served up to her guests, first the vicomte \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "21 of 2882 \n",
      "and then the abbe, as peculiarly choice morsels. The \n",
      "group about Mortemart immedi ately began discussing the \n",
      "murder of the Duc d’Enghien. The vicomte said that the \n",

      "‘Contez nous cela, Vicomte.’ \n",
      "The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of \n",

      "The princess smiled. She rose with the same \n",

      "admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, \n",
      "and bosom- which in the fashion of those days were very \n",

      "by its pressure on the table, now at her still more beautiful \n",

      "From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, \n",

      "more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was \n",
      "exceedingly ugly. His features were like his sister’s, but \n",
      "while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous, self-\n",
      "satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and \n",
      "by the wonderful classic beauty  of her figure, his face on \n",
      "the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant \n",
      "expression of sullen self-c onfidence, while his body was \n",
      "thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed \n",
      "puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms \n",
      "and legs always fell into unnatural positions. \n",
      "‘It’s not going to be a ghost story?’ said he, sitting \n",

      "He spoke with such self-c onfidence that his hearers \n",

      "‘I say so,’ he continued desperately, ‘because the \n",
      "Bourbons fled from the Revolution leaving the people to \n",

      "this youth how foolish his words were, ‘high-sounding \n",
      "words which have long been discredited. Who does not \n",
      "love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached \n",
      "liberty and equality. Have people since the Revolution \n",

      "Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile \n",
      "from Pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their \n",
      "hostess. In the first moment of Pierre’s outburst Anna \n",
      "Pavlovna, despite her social experience, was horror-\n",
      "struck. But when she saw that Pierre’s sacrilegious words \n",
      "had not exasperated the vi comte, and had convinced \n",
      "herself that it was impossible to stop him, she rallied her \n",

      "Pierre, not knowing whom to  answer, looked at them \n",

      "other people. When he smiled, his grave, even rather \n",
      "gloomy, look was instantaneous ly replaced by another- a \n",
      "childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to \n",
      "ask forgiveness. \n",
      "The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time \n",

      "his words suggested. All were silent. \n",
      "‘How do you expect him to answer you all at once?’ \n",

      "private person, as a general, and as an emperor. So it \n",
      "seems to me.’ \n",

      "began: \n",
      "‘I was told a charming Moscow story today and must \n",

      "Russian or the point will be  lost....’ And Prince Hippolyte \n",

      "would speak after spending about a year in Russia. \n",
      "Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he \n",
      "demand their attention to his story. \n",
      "‘There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very \n",
      "stingy. She must have two f ootmen behind her carriage, \n",
      "and very big ones. That was her taste. And she had a \n",
      "lady’s maid, also big. She said..’ \n",
      "Here Prince Hippolyte pause d, evidently collecting his \n",
      "ideas with difficulty. War and Peace  \n",
      "44 of 2882 \n",
      "‘She said... Oh yes! She said, ‘Girl,’ to the maid, ‘put \n",
      "on a livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me \n",
      "while I make some calls.’’ \n",
      "Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out \n",
      "laughing long before his audi ence, which produced an \n",
      "effect unfavorable to the narrator. Several persons, among \n",
      "them the elderly lady and Anna Pavlovna, did however \n",
      "smile. \n",
      "‘She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl \n",
      "lost her hat and her long ha ir came down....’ Here he \n",
      "could contain himself no l onger and went on, between \n",
      "gasps of laughter: ‘And the whole world knew...’ \n",
      "And so the anecdote ended. Though it was \n",
      "unintelligible why he had told it, or why it had to be told \n",
      "in Russian, still Anna Pavlovna and the others appreciated \n",
      "Prince Hippolyte’s social tact in so agreeably ending \n",
      "Pierre’s unpleasant and una miable outburst. After the \n",
      "anecdote the conversation br oke up into insignificant \n",

      "Chapter VI \n",
      "Having thanked Anna Pavlovna for her charming \n",
      "soiree, the guests began to take their leave. \n",
      "Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, \n",
      "broad, with huge red hands; he did not know, as the \n",
      "saying is, to enter a drawing room and still less how to \n",
      "leave one; that is, how to say something particularly \n",
      "agreeable before going away. Besides this he was absent-\n",
      "minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his \n",
      "own, the general’s three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling \n",
      "at the plume, till the general asked him to restore it. All \n",
      "his absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and \n",
      "converse in it was, however,  redeemed by his kindly, \n",
      "simple, and modest expression. Anna Pavlovna turned \n",
      "toward him and, with a Christ ian mildness that expressed \n",
      "forgiveness of his indiscretion, nodded and said: ‘I hope \n",
      "to see you again, but I also  hope you will change your \n",
      "opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre.’ \n",
      "When she said this, he di d not reply and only bowed, \n",

      "unless perhaps, ‘Opinions are opinions, but you see what War and Peace  \n",
      "46 of 2882 \n",
      "a capital, good-natured fe llow I am.’ And everyone, \n",
      "including Anna Pavlovna, felt this. \n",
      "Prince Andrew had gone out in to the hall, and, turning \n",
      "his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on \n",
      "with his cloak, listened indiffere ntly to his wife’s chatter \n",
      "with Prince Hippolyte who had also come into the hall. \n",
      "Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant \n",
      "princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass. \n",
      "‘Go in, Annette, or you will ca tch cold,’ said the little \n",
      "princess, taking leave of Anna  Pavlovna. ‘It is settled,’ \n",
      "she added in a low voice. \n",
      "Anna Pavlovna had already managed to speak to Lise \n",
      "about the match she contemplated between Anatole and \n",
      "the little princess’ sister-in-law. \n",

      "a shawl and a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. \n",
      "They listened to the French sentences which to them were \n",
      "meaningless, with an air of understanding but not wishing \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "47 of 2882 \n",
      "to appear to do so. The princess as usual spoke smilingly \n",
      "and listened with a laugh. \n",

      "infantry officers he wore no mustache, so that his mouth, \n",
      "the most striking feature of his face, was clearly seen. The \n",
      "lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The \n",

      "68 of 2882 \n",

      "The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication \n",
      "whether he intended to accept this challenge or not. \n",
      "Anatole did not release him,  and though he kept nodding \n",
      "to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating \n",
      "Dolokhov’s words into English. A thin young lad, an \n",
      "hussar of the Life Guards, who had been losing that \n",
      "evening, climbed on the window sill, leaned over, and \n",
      "looked down. \n",
      "‘Oh! Oh! Oh!’ he muttered, looking down from the \n",
      "window at the stones of the pavement. \n",
      "‘Shut up!’ cried Dolokhov, pushing him away from the \n",

      "tripping over his spurs. \n",
      "Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "71 of 2882 \n",
      "then to the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought \n",
      "two candles and placed them on the window sill, though it \n",
      "was already quite light. Do lokhov’s back in his white \n",
      "shirt, and his curly head, were lit up from both sides. \n",
      "Everyone crowded to the window, the Englishman in \n",
      "front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man, older than \n",
      "the others present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared \n",
      "and angry look and wanted to seize hold of Dolokhov’s \n",
      "shirt. \n",
      "‘I say, this is folly! He’ll be killed,’ said this more \n",

      "‘If anyone comes meddling again,’ said he, emitting \n",
      "the words separately through hi s thin compressed lips, ‘I \n",
      "will throw him down there. Now then!’ \n",
      "Saying this he again turn ed round, dropped his hands, \n",
      "took the bottle and lifted it to  his lips, threw back his \n",

      "72 of 2882 \n",
      "from the window and from Dolokhov’s back. Anatole \n",
      "stood erect with staring eyes . The Englishman looked on \n",
      "sideways, pursing up his lips. The man who had wished to \n",
      "stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw \n",
      "himself on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his \n",
      "face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his \n",

      "till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand \n",
      "holding the bottle was lifte d higher and higher and \n",
      "trembled with the effort. The bottle was emptying \n",
      "perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet \n",
      "further back. ‘Why is it so  long?’ thought Pierre. It \n",
      "seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed. \n",
      "Suddenly Dolokhov made a backward movement with his \n",
      "spine, and his arm trembled nervously; this was sufficient \n",
      "to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping \n",
      "ledge. As he began slippi ng down, his head and arm \n",
      "wavered still more with the strain. One hand moved as if \n",
      "to clutch the window sill, but refrained from touching it. \n",
      "Pierre again covered his eyes  and thought he would never \n",
      "never them again. Suddenly he was aware of a stir all \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "73 of 2882 \n",
      "around. He looked up: Dolokhov was standing on the \n",
      "window sill, with a pale but radiant face. \n",
      "‘It’s empty.’ \n",
      "He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it \n",
      "neatly. Dolokhov jumped down. He smelt strongly of \n",
      "rum. \n",
      "‘Well done!... Fine fellow!... There’s a bet for you!... \n",
      "Devil take you!’ came from different sides. \n",
      "The Englishman took out his purse and began counting \n",
      "out the money. Dolokhov stood frowning and did not \n",
      "speak. Pierre jumped upon the window sill. \n",
      "‘Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I’ll do the \n",
      "same thing!’ he suddenly cr ied. ‘Even without a bet, \n",
      "there! Tell them to bring me a bottle. I’ll do it.... Bring a \n",

      "you!... Why, you go giddy even on a staircase,’ exclaimed \n",
      "several voices. \n",

      "dresses and say, ‘I am so de lighted... Mamma’s health... \n",
      "and Countess Apraksina... and then, again rustling, pass \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "79 of 2882 \n",
      "into the anteroom, put on cloaks or mantles, and drive \n",
      "away. The conversation was on the chief topic of the day: \n",
      "the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of \n",
      "Catherine’s day, Count Bezukhov, and about his \n",
      "illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had behaved so \n",
      "improperly at Anna Pavlovna’s reception. \n",
      "‘I am so sorry for the poor count,’ said the visitor. ‘He \n",
      "is in such bad health, and now this vexation about his son \n",
      "is enough to kill him!’ \n",
      "‘What is that?’ asked the countess as if she did not \n",
      "know what the visitor alluded to, though she had already \n",
      "heard about the cause of C ount Bezukhov’s distress some \n",
      "fifteen times. \n",
      "‘That’s what comes of a modern education,’ exclaimed \n",
      "the visitor. ‘It seems that while he was abroad this young \n",
      "man was allowed to do as he  liked, now in Petersburg I \n",
      "hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has \n",
      "been expelled by the police.’ \n",
      "‘You don’t say so!’ replied the countess. \n",
      "‘He chose his friends badly,’ interposed Anna \n",
      "Mikhaylovna. ‘Prince Vasili ’s son, he, and a certain \n",
      "Dolokhov have, it is said, been up to heaven only knows \n",
      "what! And they have had to suffer for it. Dolokhov has \n",
      "been degraded to the ranks and Bezukhov’s son sent back War and Peace  \n",
      "80 of 2882 \n",
      "to Moscow. Anatole Kuragin’s father managed somehow \n",
      "to get his son’s affair hushed up, but even he was ordered \n",
      "out of Petersburg.’ \n",
      "‘But what have they been up to?’ asked the countess. \n",
      "‘They are regular brigands, especially Dolokhov,’ \n",
      "replied the visitor. ‘He is  a son of Marya Ivanovna \n",
      "Dolokhova, such a worthy woman, but there, just fancy! \n",
      "Those three got hold of a bear  s o m e w h e r e ,  p u t  i t  i n  a  \n",
      "carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The \n",
      "police tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? \n",
      "They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put \n",
      "the bear into the Moyka Canal. And there was the bear \n",
      "swimming about with the policeman on his back!’ \n",
      "‘What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my \n",
      "dear!’ shouted the count, dying with laughter. \n",
      "‘Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?’ \n",
      "Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing. \n",
      "‘It was all they could do to rescue the poor man,’ \n",
      "continued the visitor. ‘And to think it is Cyril \n",
      "Vladimirovich Bezukhov’s son who amuses himself in \n",
      "this sensible manner! And he was said to be so well \n",
      "educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education \n",
      "has done for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will \n",
      "receive him, in spite of his money. They wanted to \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "81 of 2882 \n",
      "introduce him to me, but I qu ite declined: I have my \n",
      "daughters to consider.’ \n",
      "‘Why do you say this young man is so rich?’ asked the \n",
      "countess, turning away from  the girls, who at once \n",
      "assumed an air of inattention. ‘His children are all \n",
      "illegitimate. I think Pierre also is illegitimate.’ \n",
      "The visitor made a gesture with her hand. \n",
      "‘I should think he has a score of them.’ \n",
      "Princess Anna Mikhaylovna  intervened in the \n",
      "conversation, evidently wishi ng to show her connections \n",
      "and knowledge of what went on in society. \n",
      "‘The fact of the matter is,’  said she significantly, and \n",
      "also in a half whisper, ‘everyone knows Count Cyril’s \n",
      "reputation.... He has lost count  of his children, but this \n",
      "Pierre was his favorite.’ \n",
      "‘How handsome the old man still was only a year ago!’ \n",
      "remarked the countess. ‘I have never seen a handsomer \n",
      "man.’ \n",
      "‘He is very much altered now,’ said Anna \n",
      "Mikhaylovna. ‘Well, as I was saying, Prince Vasili is the \n",
      "next heir through his wife, but  the count is very fond of \n",
      "Pierre, looked after his e ducation, and wrote to the \n",
      "Emperor about him; so that in  the case of his death- and \n",
      "he is so ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. War and Peace  \n",
      "82 of 2882 \n",
      "Lorrain has come from Petersburg- no one knows who \n",
      "will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre or Prince Vasili. \n",
      "Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know it all \n",
      "very well for Prince Vasili told me himself. Besides, Cyril \n",
      "Vladimirovich is my mother’s  second cousin. He’s also \n",
      "my Bory’s godfather,’ she added, as if she attached no \n",
      "importance at all to the fact. \n",
      "‘Prince Vasili arrived in Mosc ow yesterday. I hear he \n",
      "has come on some inspection business,’ remarked the \n",
      "visitor. \n",
      "‘Yes, but between ourselves,’ said the princess, that is \n",
      "a pretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril \n",
      "Vladimirovich, hearing how ill he is.’ \n",
      "‘But do you know, my dear, th at was a capital joke,’ \n",
      "said the count; and seeing that the elder visitor was not \n",
      "listening, he turned to the young ladies. ‘I can just \n",
      "imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut!’ \n",
      "And as he waved his arms to impersonate the \n",
      "policeman, his portly form again shook with a deep \n",
      "ringing laugh, the laugh of one who always eats well and, \n",
      "in particular, drinks well. ‘So do come and dine with us!’ \n",
      "he said. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "83 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XI \n",
      "Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, \n",
      "smiling affably, but not concealing the fact that she would \n",
      "not be distressed if they now  rose and took their leave. \n",
      "The visitor’s daughter was already smoothing down her \n",
      "dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when suddenly \n",
      "from the next room were h eard the footsteps of boys and \n",
      "girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling \n",
      "over, and a girl of thirteen, hiding something in the folds \n",
      "of her short muslin frock, da rted in and stopped short in \n",
      "the middle of the room. It wa s evident that she had not \n",
      "intended her flight to bring he r so far. Behi nd her in the \n",
      "doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an \n",
      "officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-\n",
      "faced boy in a short jacket. \n",
      "The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, \n",
      "spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl \n",
      "who had run in. \n",
      "‘Ah, here she is!’ he exclaimed laughing. ‘My pet, \n",
      "whose name day it is. My dear pet!’ War and Peace  \n",
      "84 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Ma chere, there is a time for everything,’ said the \n",
      "countess with feigned severit y. ‘You spoil her, Ilya,’ she \n",
      "added, turning to her husband. \n",
      "‘How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy \n",
      "returns of your name day,’ said the visitor. ‘What a \n",
      "charming child,’ she added, addressing the mother. \n",
      "This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full \n",
      "of life- with childish bare shoulders which after her run \n",
      "heaved and shook her bodice, with black curls tossed \n",
      "backward, thin bare arms, little legs in lace-frilled \n",
      "drawers, and feet in low s lippers- was just at that \n",
      "charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the \n",
      "child is not yet a young woman. Escaping from her father \n",
      "she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her mother’s \n",
      "mantilla- not paying the least attention to her severe \n",
      "remark- and began to laugh. She laughed, and in \n",
      "fragmentary sentences tried to  explain about a doll which \n",
      "she produced from the folds of her frock. \n",
      "‘Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...’ was all \n",
      "Natasha managed to utter (to her everything seemed \n",
      "funny). She leaned against her mother and burst into such \n",
      "a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even the prim visitor \n",
      "could not help joining in. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "85 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Now then, go away and ta ke your monstrosity with \n",
      "you,’ said the mother, pushing away her daughter with \n",
      "pretended sternness, and turning to the visitor she added: \n",
      "‘She is my youngest girl.’ \n",
      "Natasha, raising her face for a moment from her \n",
      "mother’s mantilla, glanced up at her through tears of \n",
      "laughter, and again hid her face. \n",
      "The visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, \n",
      "thought it necessary to take some part in it. \n",
      "‘Tell me, my dear,’ said she to Natasha, ‘is Mimi a \n",
      "relation of yours? A daughter, I suppose?’ \n",
      "Natasha did not like the visitor’s tone of condescension \n",
      "to childish things. She did not reply, but looked at her \n",
      "seriously. \n",
      "Meanwhile the younger generatio n: Boris, the officer, \n",
      "Anna Mikhaylovna’s son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, \n",

      "restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and \n",
      "mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently in the back \n",
      "rooms, from which they had dashed out so impetuously, \n",
      "the conversation had been more amusing than the \n",
      "drawing-room talk of societ y scandals, the weather, and War and Peace  \n",
      "86 of 2882 \n",
      "Countess Apraksina. Now and then they glanced at one \n",
      "another, hardly able to suppress their laughter. \n",
      "The two young men, the st udent and the officer, \n",
      "friends from childhood, were of the same age and both \n",
      "handsome fellows, though not alike. Boris was tall and \n",
      "fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate \n",
      "features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open \n",
      "expression. Dark hairs were already showing on his upper \n",
      "lip, and his whole face expressed impetuosity and \n",
      "enthusiasm. Nicholas blushed when he entered the \n",
      "drawing room. He evidently tried to find something to \n",
      "say, but failed. Boris on th e contrary at once found his \n",
      "footing, and related quietly and humorously how he had \n",
      "know that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young \n",
      "lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged \n",
      "during the five years he had known her, and how her head \n",
      "had cracked right across the skull. Having said this he \n",
      "glanced at Natasha. She tu rned away from him and \n",
      "glanced at her younger brothe r, who was screwing up his \n",
      "eyes and shaking with suppr essed laughter, and unable to \n",
      "control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed \n",
      "from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry \n",

      "head, and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in \n",
      "the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms \n",
      "and neck. By the grace of her movements, by the softness \n",
      "and flexibility of her sm all limbs, and by a certain \n",
      "coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a \n",
      "pretty, half-grown kitten which promises to become a \n",
      "beautiful little cat. She evid ently considered it proper to \n",
      "show an interest in the general conversation by smiling, \n",
      "but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long \n",

      "‘Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I’ve mixed \n",
      "everything up. One has so many relatives in Moscow! So \n",

      "that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my \n",
      "mother among such people. We are very poor, but for my \n",

      "For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when \n",
      "he did, he jumped up from the sofa, seized Boris under \n",
      "the elbow in his quick, clumsy way, and, blushing far \n",
      "more than Boris, began to speak with a feeling of mingled \n",
      "shame and vexation. \n",
      "‘Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could \n",
      "think?... I know very well..’ \n",
      "But Boris again interrupted him. \n",
      "‘I am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not \n",
      "like it? You must excuse me,’  said he, putting Pierre at \n",
      "ease instead of being put at ease by him, ‘but I hope I \n",
      "have not offended you. I always make it a rule to speak \n",
      "out... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you come to \n",

      "situation and placed another in  it, became quite pleasant \n",
      "again. \n",
      "‘No, but I say,’ said Pierre, calming down, ‘you are a \n",
      "wonderful fellow! What you have just said is good, very \n",
      "good. Of course you don’t know me. We have not met for \n",
      "such a long time... not since we were children. You might War and Peace  \n",

      "but it’s splendid. I am very  glad to have made your \n",
      "acquaintance. It’s queer,’ he added after a pause, ‘that you \n",
      "should have suspected me!’ He  began to laugh. ‘Well, \n",
      "what of it! I hope we’ll ge t better acquainted,’ and he \n",

      "bending his head first to one side and then to the other War and Peace  \n",
      "130 of 2882 \n",
      "watched the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to \n",

      "having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was \n",
      "inhaling the smoke spasmodi cally and screwing up his \n",
      "eyes. This was an old bachelor, Shinshin, a cousin of the \n",
      "countess’, a man with ‘a shar p tongue’ as th ey said in \n",
      "Moscow society. He seemed to be condescending to his \n",

      "pipe in the middle of his mout h and with red lips gently \n",

      "The count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing \n",

      "oblivious of irony or indiffere nce, continued to explain \n",
      "how by exchanging into the Guards he had already gained \n",
      "a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps; how in \n",

      "enjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem to suspect that \n",
      "others, too, might have their own interests. But all he said \n",
      "was so prettily sedate, and the naivete of his youthful \n",
      "egotism was so obvious, that he disarmed his hearers. \n",
      "‘Well, my boy, you’ll get along wherever you go- foot \n",
      "or horse- that I’ll wa rrant,’ said Shinshin, patting him on \n",
      "the shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa. \n",
      "Berg smiled joyously. The count, by his guests, went \n",

      "naively looking around through his spectacles as if in \n",
      "search of somebody and answered all her questions in \n",
      "monosyllables. He was in the way and was the only one \n",
      "who did not notice the fact. Most of the guests, knowing \n",
      "of the affair with the bear, looked with curiosity at this \n",
      "big, stout, quiet man, wondering how such a clumsy, \n",
      "modest fellow could have played such a prank on a \n",

      "one another. ‘The Razumovskis... It was charming... You \n",

      "Marya Dmitrievna entered the room. \n",
      "All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones \n",

      "head with its gray curls, she stood surveying the guests, \n",
      "and leisurely arranged her wide  sleeves as if rolling them \n",

      "The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the \n",

      "ribbons, and busily filled his neighbors’ glasses, not War and Peace  \n",
      "138 of 2882 \n",

      "behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald \n",
      "head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual \n",

      "of hussars who, growing more  and more flushed, ate and \n",
      "drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern to \n",

      "mortified because no one would understand that it was not \n",

      "with a grown-up man, who had been abroad. She was \n",
      "sitting in a conspicuous plac e and talking to him like a \n",

      "both with merry countenances. The count, with playful \n",
      "ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his bent arm \n",
      "to Marya Dmitrievna. He drew himself up, a smile of \n",
      "debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "153 of 2882 \n",
      "figure of the ecossaise was ended, he clapped his hands to \n",

      "curved his arms, beat time, straightened his shoulders, \n",
      "turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by a \n",
      "smile that broadened his round face more and more, \n",

      "was expressed by the whole of  the count’s plump figure, \n",
      "in Marya Dmitrievna found expression only in her more \n",
      "and more beaming face and quivering nose. But if the \n",
      "count, getting more and more into the swing of it, \n",
      "charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his \n",
      "adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered \n",

      "move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or \n",
      "stamp her foot- which everyone  appreciated in view of \n",
      "her size and habitual severity. The dance grew livelier and \n",

      "attention to their own evoluti ons and did not even try to \n",
      "do so. All were watching the count and Marya \n",
      "Dmitrievna. Natasha kept pul ling everyone by sleeve or \n",

      "‘But, my dear,’ said Prince Vasili suddenly, clutching \n",
      "the little table and becoming more animated and talking \n",
      "more rapidly: ‘what if a lett er has been written to the \n",
      "Emperor in which the count asks for Pierre’s \n",
      "legitimation? Do you understand  that in consideration of \n",
      "the count’s services, his request would be granted?..’ \n",
      "The princess smiled as people do who think they know \n",
      "more about the subject under discussion than those they \n",

      "her hand, ‘that letter was wr itten, though it was not sent, War and Peace  \n",
      "164 of 2882 \n",
      "and the Emperor knew of it. The only question is, has it \n",
      "been destroyed or not? If not, then as soon  as all is over,’ \n",
      "and Prince Vasili sighed to intimate what he meant by the \n",
      "words all is over, ‘and the c ount’s papers are opened, the \n",
      "will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and the \n",
      "petition will certainly be granted. Pierre will get \n",
      "everything as the legitimate son.’ \n",
      "‘And our share?’ asked the princess smiling ironically, \n",
      "as if anything might happen, only not that. \n",
      "‘But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He \n",
      "will then be the legal heir to everything and you won’t get \n",

      "ought to know where they are, and must find them, \n",
      "because..’ \n",
      "‘What next?’ the princess interrupted, smiling \n",
      "sardonically and not changing the expression of her eyes. \n",
      "‘I am a woman, and you think we are all stupid; but I \n",
      "know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit... un \n",

      "so intelligent, how is it you don’t see that if the count has \n",
      "written a letter to the Emperor begging him to recognize \n",
      "Pierre as legitimate, it follows that Pierre will not be \n",
      "Pierre but will become C ount Bezukhov, and will then \n",

      "Anna Mikhaylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, \n",
      "who could not help seeing th ese people, took any notice \n",
      "of them. ‘It seems to be all right,’ Pierre concluded, and \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "171 of 2882 \n",
      "followed Anna Mikhaylovna. She hurriedly ascended the \n",
      "narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to Pierre, who \n",
      "was lagging behind, to follow. Though he did not see why \n",
      "it was necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less \n",
      "why he had to go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna \n",
      "Mikhaylovna’s air of assurance and haste, Pierre \n",
      "concluded that it was all absolutely necessary. Halfway \n",
      "up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men \n",
      "who, carrying pails, came r unning downstairs, their boots \n",
      "clattering. These men pressed close to the wall to let \n",
      "Pierre and Anna Mikhaylovna pass and did not evince the \n",
      "least surprise at seeing them there. \n",
      "‘Is this the way to the princesses’ apartments?’ asked \n",
      "Anna Mikhaylovna of one of them. \n",
      "‘Yes,’ replied a footman in  a bold loud voice, as if \n",
      "anything were now permissible; ‘the door to the left, \n",
      "ma’am.’ \n",
      "‘Perhaps the count did not ask for me,’ said Pierre \n",
      "when he reached the landing. ‘I’d better go to my own \n",
      "room.’ \n",
      "Anna Mikhaylovna paused and waited for him to come \n",
      "up. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "172 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Ah, my friend!’ she said, touching his arm as she had \n",
      "done her son’s when speaki ng to him that afternoon, \n",
      "‘believe me I suffer no less than you do, but be a man!’ \n",
      "‘But really, hadn’t I better go away?’ he asked, looking \n",
      "kindly at her over his spectacles. \n",
      "‘Ah, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have \n",
      "been done you. Think that he is your father... perhaps in \n",
      "the agony of death.’ She si ghed. ‘I have loved you like a \n",
      "son from the first. Trust yourself to me, Pierre. I shall not \n",
      "forget your interests.’ \n",
      "Pierre did not understand a word, but the conviction \n",
      "that all this had to be gr ew stronger, and he meekly \n",
      "followed Anna Mikhaylovna who was already opening a \n",
      "door. \n",
      "This door led into a back anteroom. An old man, a \n",
      "servant of the princesses, sat in a corner knitting a \n",
      "stocking. Pierre had never been  in this part of the house \n",
      "and did not even know of the existence of these rooms. \n",
      "Anna Mikhaylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying \n",
      "past with a decanter on a tray as ‘my dear’ and ‘my \n",
      "sweet,’ asked about the princess’ health and then led \n",
      "Pierre along a stone passage. The first door on the left led \n",
      "into the princesses’ apartments. The maid with the \n",
      "decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "173 of 2882 \n",
      "in the house was done in haste at that time), and Pierre \n",
      "and Anna Mikhaylovna in pass ing instinctively glanced \n",
      "into the room, where Prince Vasili and the eldest princess \n",
      "were sitting close together talking. Seeing them pass, \n",
      "Prince Vasili drew back with obvious impatience, while \n",
      "the princess jumped up and w ith a gesture of desperation \n",
      "slammed the door with all her might. \n",
      "This action was so unlike her usual composure and the \n",
      "fear depicted on Prince Vasili’s face so out of keeping \n",
      "with his dignity that Pierre stopped and glanced \n",
      "inquiringly over his spectacle s at his guide. Anna \n",
      "Mikhaylovna evinced no surpri se, she only smiled faintly \n",
      "and sighed, as if to say that this was no more than she had \n",
      "expected. \n",
      "‘Be a man, my friend. I will look after your interests,’ \n",
      "said she in reply to his look, and went still faster along the \n",
      "passage. \n",
      "Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and \n",
      "still less what ‘watching over his interests’ meant, but he \n",
      "decided that all these things had to be. From the passage \n",
      "they went into a large, dimly lit room adjoining the \n",
      "count’s reception room. It was one of those sumptuous \n",
      "but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front \n",
      "approach, but even in this room there now stood an empty War and Peace  \n",
      "174 of 2882 \n",
      "bath, and water had been spilled on the carpet. They were \n",
      "met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who \n",
      "passed out on tiptoe without heeding them. They went \n",
      "into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian \n",
      "windows opening into the cons ervatory, with its large \n",
      "bust and full length portrait of Catherine the Great. The \n",
      "same people were still sitting here in almost the same \n",
      "positions as before, whispering to one another. All \n",
      "became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn \n",
      "Anna Mikhaylovna as she entered, and at the big stout \n",
      "figure of Pierre who, hanging his head, meekly followed \n",
      "her. \n",
      "Anna Mikhaylovna’s face expressed a consciousness \n",
      "that the decisive moment ha d arrived. With the air of a \n",
      "practical Petersburg lady she now, keeping Pierre close \n",
      "beside her, entered the room even more boldly than that \n",
      "afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her the person \n",
      "the dying man wished to see, her own admission was \n",
      "assured. Casting a rapid glance at all those in the room \n",
      "and noticing the count’s confessor there, she glided up to \n",
      "him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet seeming \n",
      "to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the \n",
      "blessing first of one and then of another priest. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "175 of 2882 \n",
      "‘God be thanked that you are in time,’ said she to one \n",
      "of the priests; ‘all we relatives have been in such anxiety. \n",
      "This young man is the count’s son,’ she added more \n",
      "softly. ‘What a terrible moment!’ \n",
      "Having said this she went up to the doctor. \n",
      "‘Dear doctor,’ said she, ‘this young man is the count’s \n",
      "son. Is there any hope?’ \n",
      "The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently \n",
      "shrugged his shoulders. Anna Mikhaylovna with just the \n",
      "same movement raised her shoulders and eyes, almost \n",
      "closing the latter, sighed, and moved away from the \n",
      "doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful and \n",
      "tenderly sad voice, she said: \n",
      "‘Trust in His mercy!’ and pointing out a small sofa for \n",
      "him to sit and wait for her, she went silently toward the \n",
      "door that everyone was watching and it creaked very \n",
      "slightly as she disappeared behind it. \n",
      "Pierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress \n",
      "implicitly, moved toward the sofa she had indicated. As \n",
      "soon as Anna Mikhaylovna had disappeared he noticed \n",
      "that the eyes of all in the room turned to him with \n",
      "something more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed \n",
      "that they whispered to one  another, casting significant \n",
      "looks at him with a kind of  awe and even servility. A War and Peace  \n",
      "176 of 2882 \n",
      "deference such as he had never before received was \n",
      "shown him. A strange lady, the one who had been talking \n",
      "to the priests, rose and offered him her seat; an aide-de-\n",
      "camp picked up and returned a glove Pierre had dropped; \n",
      "the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by, \n",
      "and moved to make way for him.  At first Pierre wished to \n",
      "take another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to \n",
      "pick up the glove himself a nd to pass round the doctors \n",
      "who were not even in his way;  but all at once he felt that \n",
      "this would not do, and that  tonight he was a person \n",
      "obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which \n",
      "everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore \n",
      "bound to accept their services. He took the glove in \n",
      "silence from the aide-de-camp, and sat down in the lady’s \n",
      "chair, placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees \n",
      "in the naive attitude of an Egyptian statue, and decided in \n",
      "his own mind that all was as it should be, and that in order \n",
      "not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act \n",
      "on his own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up \n",
      "entirely to the will of those who were guiding him. \n",
      "Not two minutes had passed be fore Prince Vasili with \n",
      "head erect majestically entered the room. He was wearing \n",
      "his long coat with three stars on his breast. He seemed to \n",
      "have grown thinner since the morning; his eyes seemed \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "177 of 2882 \n",
      "larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed \n",
      "Pierre. He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never \n",
      "used to do), and drew it downwards as if wishing to \n",
      "ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on. \n",
      "‘Courage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see \n",
      "you. That is well!’ and he turned to go. \n",
      "But Pierre thought it necessary  to ask: ‘How is...’ and \n",
      "hesitated, not knowing whether it would be proper to call \n",
      "the dying man ‘the count,’ yet ashamed to call him \n",
      "‘father.’ \n",
      "‘He had another stroke about half an hour ago. \n",
      "Courage, my friend..’ \n",
      "Pierre’s mind was in such a confused state that the \n",
      "word ‘stroke’ suggested to him a blow from something. \n",
      "He looked at Prince Vasili in  perplexity, and only later \n",
      "grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness. Prince \n",
      "Vasili said something to Lorrain in passing and went \n",
      "through the door on tiptoe. He  could not walk well on \n",
      "tiptoe and his whole body jerked at each step. The eldest \n",
      "princess followed him, and the priests and deacons and \n",
      "some servants also went in at the door. Through that door \n",
      "was heard a noise of things being moved about, and at last \n",
      "Anna Mikhaylovna, still with the same expression, pale War and Peace  \n",
      "178 of 2882 \n",
      "but resolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching \n",
      "Pierre lightly on the arm said: \n",
      "‘The divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to \n",
      "be administered. Come.’ \n",
      "Pierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, \n",
      "and noticed that the strange  lady, the aide-de-camp, and \n",
      "some of the servants, all followed him in, as if there were \n",
      "now no further need for permission to enter that room. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "179 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XXIII \n",
      "Pierre well knew this larg e room divided by columns \n",
      "and an arch, its walls hung round with Persian carpets. \n",
      "The part of the room behind the columns, with a high silk-\n",
      "curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on the \n",
      "other an immense case contai ning icons, was brightly \n",
      "illuminated with red light like a Russian church during \n",
      "evening service. Under the gleaming icons stood a long \n",
      "invalid chair, and in that  chair on snowy-white smooth \n",
      "pillows, evidently freshly changed, Pierre saw- covered to \n",
      "the waist by a bright green quilt- the familiar, majestic \n",
      "figure of his father, Count Bezukhov, with that gray mane \n",
      "of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a \n",
      "lion, and the deep characterist ically noble wrinkles of his \n",
      "handsome, ruddy face. He lay just under the icons; his \n",
      "large thick hands outside the quilt. Into the right hand, \n",
      "which was lying palm downwards, a wax taper had been \n",
      "thrust between forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, \n",
      "bending over from behind the chair, held it in position. By \n",
      "the chair stood the priests, their long hair falling over their \n",
      "magnificent glittering vestment s, with lighted tapers in \n",
      "their hands, slowly and solemnly conducting the service. War and Peace  \n",
      "180 of 2882 \n",
      "A little behind them stood the two younger princesses \n",
      "holding handkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in front of \n",
      "them their eldest sister, Catiche, with a vicious and \n",
      "determined look steadily fixed on the icons, as though \n",
      "declaring to all that she c ould not answer for herself \n",
      "should she glance round. Anna Mikhaylovna, with a \n",
      "meek, sorrowful, and all-forgiving expression on her face, \n",
      "stood by the door near the strange lady. Prince Vasili in \n",
      "front of the door, near the inva lid chair, a wax taper in his \n",
      "left hand, was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a \n",
      "velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose, and was \n",
      "crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes \n",
      "upward each time he touched hi s forehead. His face wore \n",
      "a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of God. ‘If \n",
      "you do not understand these sentiments,’ he seemed to be \n",
      "saying, ‘so much the worse for you!’ \n",
      "Behind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and \n",
      "the menservants; the men and women had separated as in \n",
      "church. All were silently crossing themselves, and the \n",
      "reading of the church serv ice, the subdued chanting of \n",
      "deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and the \n",
      "shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard. \n",
      "Anna Mikhaylovna, with an air of importance that \n",
      "showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "181 of 2882 \n",
      "went across the room to wh ere Pierre was standing and \n",
      "gave him a taper. He lit it and, distracted by observing \n",
      "those around him, began cro ssing himself with the hand \n",
      "that held the taper. \n",
      "Sophie, the rosy, laught er-loving, youngest princess \n",
      "with the mole, watched him. She smiled, hid her face in \n",
      "her handkerchief, and remained with it hidden for awhile; \n",
      "then looking up and seeing Pi erre she again began to \n",
      "laugh. She evidently felt unabl e to look at him without \n",
      "laughing, but could not resist looki ng at him: so to be out \n",
      "of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the \n",
      "columns. In the midst of th e service the voices of the \n",
      "priests suddenly ceased, they  whispered to one another, \n",
      "and the old servant who was holding the count’s hand got \n",
      "up and said something to the ladies. Anna Mikhaylovna \n",
      "stepped forward and, stoopi ng over the dying man, \n",
      "beckoned to Lorrain from be hind her back. The French \n",
      "doctor held no taper; he was leaning against one of the \n",
      "columns in a respectful attitude implying that he, a \n",
      "foreigner, in spite of all di fferences of faith, understood \n",
      "the full importance of the r ite now being performed and \n",
      "even approved of it. He now approached the sick man \n",
      "with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life, with his \n",
      "delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand War and Peace  \n",
      "182 of 2882 \n",
      "that was free, and turning si deways felt the pulse and \n",
      "reflected a moment. The sick man was given something to \n",
      "drink, there was a stir around him, then the people \n",
      "resumed their places and th e service continued. During \n",
      "this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasili left the chair \n",
      "on which he had been lean ing, and- with air which \n",
      "intimated that he knew what he was about and if others \n",
      "did not understand him it was so much the worse for \n",
      "them- did not go up to the dying man, but passed by him, \n",
      "joined the eldest princess, a nd moved with her to the side \n",
      "of the room where stood the hi gh bedstead with its silken \n",
      "hangings. On leaving the bed both Prince Vasili and the \n",
      "princess passed out by a back door, but returned to their \n",
      "places one after the other before the service was \n",
      "concluded. Pierre paid no more attention to this \n",
      "occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made \n",
      "up his mind once for all that what he saw happening \n",
      "around him that evening was in some way essential. \n",
      "The chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the \n",
      "priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying \n",
      "man on having received the sacrament. The dying man lay \n",
      "as lifeless and immovable as before. Around him \n",
      "everyone began to stir: steps were audible and whispers, \n",
      "among which Anna Mikhaylovna’s was the most distinct. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "183 of 2882 \n",
      "Pierre heard her say: \n",
      "‘Certainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will \n",
      "be impossible..’ \n",
      "The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, \n",
      "princesses, and servants that Pierre could no longer see \n",
      "the reddish-yellow face with its gray mane- which, though \n",
      "he saw other faces as well, he  had not lost sight of for a \n",
      "single moment during the whole service. He judged by the \n",
      "cautious movements of those who crowded round the \n",
      "invalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and were \n",
      "moving him. \n",
      "‘Catch hold of my arm or you’ll drop him!’ he heard \n",
      "one of the servants say in a frightened whisper. ‘Catch \n",
      "hold from underneath. Here!’ exclaimed different voices; \n",
      "and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of \n",
      "their feet grew more hurried, as if the weight they were \n",
      "carrying were too much for them. \n",
      "As the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikhaylovna, \n",
      "passed the young man he caught a momentary glimpse \n",
      "between their heads and backs of the dying man’s high, \n",
      "stout, uncovered chest and pow erful shoulders, raised by \n",
      "those who were holding him under the armpits, and of his \n",
      "gray, curly, leonine head. This  head, with its remarkably \n",
      "broad brow and cheekbones, its handsome, sensual \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "184 of 2882 \n",
      "mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was not \n",
      "disfigured by the approach of death. It was the same as \n",
      "Pierre remembered it three months before, when the count \n",
      "had sent him to Petersburg. But now this head was \n",
      "swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the \n",
      "bearers, and the cold lis tless gaze fixed itself upon \n",
      "nothing. \n",
      "After a few minutes’ bustle beside the high bedstead, \n",
      "those who had carried the sick man dispersed. Anna \n",
      "Mikhaylovna touched Pierre’s  hand and said, ‘Come.’ \n",
      "Pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had \n",
      "been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony \n",
      "just completed. He lay with his head propped high on the \n",
      "pillows. His hands were symmetrically placed on the \n",
      "green silk quilt, the palms downward. When Pierre came \n",
      "up the count was gazing straight at him, but with a look \n",
      "the significance of which could not be understood by \n",
      "mortal man. Either this look meant nothing but that as \n",
      "long as one has eyes they mu st look somewhere, or it \n",
      "meant too much. Pierre hesitated, not knowing what to do, \n",
      "and glanced inquiringly at hi s guide. Anna Mikhaylovna \n",
      "made a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick \n",
      "man’s hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss. \n",
      "Pierre, carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "185 of 2882 \n",
      "quilt, followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the \n",
      "large boned, fleshy hand. Neither the hand nor a single \n",
      "muscle of the count’s face stirred. Once more Pierre \n",
      "looked questioningly at Anna Mikhaylovna to see what he \n",
      "was to do next. Anna Mikhaylovna with her eyes \n",
      "indicated a chair that st ood beside the bed. Pierre \n",
      "obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were doing \n",
      "right. Anna Mikhaylovna nodded approvingly. Again \n",
      "Pierre fell into the naively symmetrical pose of an \n",
      "Egyptian statue, evidently dist ressed that his stout and \n",
      "clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost \n",
      "to look as small as possible. He looked at the count, who \n",
      "still gazed at the spot where Pierre’s face had been before \n",
      "he sat down. Anna Mikhaylovna  indicated by her attitude \n",
      "her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last \n",
      "moments of meeting between the father and son. This \n",
      "lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre seemed an hour. \n",
      "Suddenly the broad muscles a nd lines of the count’s face \n",
      "began to twitch. The twitching increased, the handsome \n",
      "mouth was drawn to one side (only now did Pierre realize \n",

      "lip when necessary and drawing up again next moment \n",
      "when her face broke into a smile of glittering teeth and \n",
      "sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they had had on \n",
      "the Spasski Hill which might have been serious for her in \n",
      "her condition, and immediately after that informed them \n",
      "that she had left all her cl othes in Petersburg and that \n",

      "her beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness. It was \n",
      "plain that she was following a train of thought \n",
      "independent of her sister-in-law’s words. In the midst of a \n",
      "description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her \n",
      "brother: \n",
      "‘So you are really going to the war, Andrew?’ she said \n",
      "sighing. \n",
      "Lise sighed too. \n",
      "‘Yes, and even tomorrow,’ replied her brother. \n",
      "‘He is leaving me here , God knows why, when he \n",

      "Princess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing \n",

      "Her lip descended. She brought her face close to her \n",
      "sister-in-law’s and unexpectedly again began to cry. War and Peace  \n",
      "218 of 2882 \n",
      "‘She needs rest,’ said Pr ince Andrew with a frown. \n",
      "‘Don’t you, Lise? Take her to  your room and I’ll go to \n",
      "Father. How is he? Just the same?’ \n",
      "‘Yes, just the same. Though I don’t know what your \n",
      "opinion will be,’ answered the princess joyfully. \n",
      "‘And are the hours the same? And the walks in the \n",

      "scarcely perceptible smile which showed that, in spite of \n",

      "When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had \n",

      "from his usual routine in honor  of his son’s arrival: he \n",
      "gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he \n",

      "‘Ah! here’s the warrior! Wants to vanquish \n",
      "Buonaparte?’ said the old man, shaking his powdered \n",

      "to plait, would allow. \n",
      "‘You at least must tackle him properly, or else if he \n",
      "goes on like this he’ll soon ha ve us, too, for his subjects! \n",
      "How are you?’ And he held out his cheek. \n",
      "The old man was in a good temper after his nap before \n",
      "dinner. (He used to say that a nap ‘after dinner was silver- \n",
      "before dinner, golden.’) He cast happy, sidelong glances \n",
      "at his son from under his thick, bushy eyebrows. Prince \n",
      "Andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot \n",
      "indicated to him. He made  no reply on his father’s \n",

      "and more particularly of Bonaparte. \n",
      "‘Yes, Father, I have come come to you and brought my \n",
      "wife who is pregnant,’ said  Prince Andrew, following \n",

      "have not yet had time to settle down!’ \n",
      "‘Nonsense, nonsense!’ cried the old man, shaking his \n",

      "Princess Mary will take her th ere and show her over, and \n",

      "Mikhelson’s army I unders tand- Tolstoy’s too... a \n",
      "simultaneous expedition.... But what’s the southern army \n",
      "to do? Prussia is neutral ... I know that. What about \n",
      "Austria?’ said he, rising from his chair and pacing up and \n",
      "down the room followed by Tikhon, who ran after him, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "221 of 2882 \n",
      "handing him different articles of clothing. ‘What of \n",
      "Sweden? How will they cross Pomerania?’ \n",
      "Prince Andrew, seeing that hi s father insisted, began- \n",
      "at first reluctantly, but gra dually with more and more \n",
      "animation, and from habit changing unconsciously from \n",
      "Russian to French as he went  on- to explain the plan of \n",
      "operation for the coming campaign. He explained how an \n",
      "army, ninety thousand strong, wa s to threaten Prussia so \n",
      "as to bring her out of her neut rality and draw her into the \n",
      "war; how part of that army was to join some Swedish \n",
      "forces at Stralsund; how  two hundred and twenty \n",
      "thousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, \n",
      "were to operate in Italy and on the Rhine; how fifty \n",
      "thousand Russians and as many English were to land at \n",
      "Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand \n",
      "men was to attack the French  from different sides. The \n",
      "old prince did not evince the least interest during this \n",
      "explanation, but as if he were  not listening to it continued \n",
      "to dress while walking about, and three times \n",
      "unexpectedly interrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting: \n",
      "‘The white one, the white one!’ \n",
      "This meant that Tikhon was not handing him the \n",
      "waistcoat he wanted. Another time he interrupted, saying: War and Peace  \n",
      "222 of 2882 \n",
      "‘And will she soon be confined?’ and shaking his head \n",
      "reproachfully said: ‘That’s bad! Go on, go on.’ \n",
      "The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was \n",
      "finishing his description. The old man began to sing, in \n",
      "the cracked voice of old ag e: ‘Malbrook s’en va-t-en \n",
      "guerre. Dieu sait quand reviendra.’* \n",
      "*\"Marlborough is going to the wars; God knows when \n",
      "he’ll return.’ \n",
      "His son only smiled. \n",
      "‘I don’t say it’s a plan I approve of,’ said the son; ‘I am \n",
      "only telling you what it is. Napoleon has also formed his \n",
      "plan by now, not worse than this one.’ \n",
      "‘Well, you’ve told me nothing new,’ and the old man \n",

      "At the appointed hour the prince, powdered and \n",
      "shaven, entered the dining room where his daughter-in-\n",
      "law, Princess Mary, and Mademoiselle Bourienne were \n",
      "already awaiting him together with his architect, who by a \n",
      "strange caprice of his employer’s was admitted to table \n",
      "though the position of that insignificant individual was \n",
      "such as could certainly not have caused him to expect that \n",
      "honor. The prince, who generally kept very strictly to \n",
      "social distinctions and rarely admitted even important \n",
      "government officials to hi s table, had unexpectedly \n",
      "selected Michael Ivanovich (who always went into a \n",
      "corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief) to \n",
      "illustrate the theory that all men are equals, and had more \n",
      "than once impressed on his daughter that Michael \n",
      "Ivanovich was ‘not a whit worse than you or I.’ At dinner \n",
      "the prince usually spoke to the taciturn Michael Ivanovich \n",
      "more often than to anyone else. \n",
      "In the dining room, which like all the rooms in the \n",
      "house was exceedingly lofty, the members of the \n",
      "household and the footmen- one  behind each chair- stood \n",
      "waiting for the prince to enter. The head butler, napkin on War and Peace  \n",
      "224 of 2882 \n",
      "arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making signs to \n",
      "the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the \n",
      "door by which the prince was to enter. Prince Andrew \n",
      "was looking at a large gilt frame, new to him, containing \n",
      "the genealogical tree of the Princes Bolkonski, opposite \n",
      "which hung another such frame with a badly painted \n",
      "portrait (evidently by the ha nd of the artist belonging to \n",
      "the estate) of a ruling prince,  in a crown- an alleged \n",
      "descendant of Rurik and an cestor of the Bolkonskis. \n",
      "Prince Andrew, looking again at  that genealogical tree, \n",
      "shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at a \n",
      "portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing. \n",
      "‘How thoroughly like him that is!’ he said to Princess \n",
      "Mary, who had come up to him. \n",
      "Princess Mary looked at her brother in surprise. She \n",
      "did not understand what he was laughing at. Everything \n",
      "her father did inspired her with reverence and was beyond \n",
      "question. \n",
      "‘Everyone has his Achilles ’ heel,’ continued Prince \n",
      "Andrew. ‘Fancy, with his powerful mind, indulging in \n",
      "such nonsense!’ \n",
      "Princess Mary could not understand the boldness of \n",
      "her brother’s criticism and wa s about to reply, when the \n",
      "expected footsteps were heard coming from the study. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "225 of 2882 \n",
      "The prince walked in quick ly and jauntily as was his \n",
      "wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his \n",
      "manners with the strict form ality of his house. At that \n",
      "moment the great clock struck two and another with a \n",
      "shrill tone joined in from  the drawing room. The prince \n",
      "stood still; his lively glittering eyes from under their thick, \n",
      "bushy eyebrows sternly scanne d all present and rested on \n",
      "the little princess. She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar \n",
      "enters, the sensation of fear  and respect which the old \n",
      "man inspired in all around him. He stroked her hair and \n",
      "then patted her awkwardly on the back of her neck. \n",
      "‘I’m glad, glad, to see you,’ he said, looking attentively \n",
      "into her eyes, and then quickly  went to his place and sat \n",
      "down. ‘Sit down, sit down! Sit down, Michael Ianovich!’ \n",
      "He indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law. \n",
      "A footman moved the chair for her. \n",
      "‘Ho, ho!’ said the old man, casting his eyes on her \n",
      "rounded figure. ‘You’ve been in a hurry. That’s bad!’ \n",
      "He laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with \n",
      "his lips only and not with his eyes. \n",
      "‘You must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as \n",
      "possible,’ he said. \n",
      "The little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his \n",
      "words. She was silent and seemed confused. The prince War and Peace  \n",
      "226 of 2882 \n",
      "asked her about her father, and she began to smile and \n",
      "talk. He asked about mutu al acquaintances, and she \n",
      "became still more animated and chattered away giving \n",
      "him greetings from various pe ople and retailing the town \n",
      "gossip. \n",
      "‘Countess Apraksina, poor thing, has lost her husband \n",
      "and she has cried her eyes out ,’ she said, growing more \n",
      "and more lively. \n",
      "As she became animated the prince looked at her more \n",
      "and more sternly, and suddenl y, as if he had studied her \n",
      "sufficiently and had formed a definite idea of her, he \n",
      "turned away and addressed Michael Ivanovich. \n",
      "‘Well, Michael Ivanovich, our Bonaparte will be \n",
      "having a bad time of it. Prince  Andrew’ (he always spoke \n",
      "thus of his son) ‘has been telling me what forces are being \n",
      "collected against him! Wh ile you and I never thought \n",
      "much of him.’ \n",
      "Michael Ivanovich did not at all know when ‘you and \n",
      "I’ had said such things about Bonaparte, but \n",
      "understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to \n",
      "hang the prince’s favorite topi c, he looked inquiringly at \n",
      "the young prince, wondering what would follow. \n",
      "‘He is a great tactician!’ said the prince to his son, \n",
      "pointing to the architect. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "227 of 2882 \n",
      "And the conversation again turned on the war, on \n",
      "Bonaparte, and the generals and statesmen of the day. The \n",
      "old prince seemed convinced no t only that all the men of \n",
      "the day were mere babies w ho did not know the A B C of \n",
      "war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an insignificant \n",
      "little Frenchy, successful onl y because there were no \n",
      "longer any Potemkins or Suvorovs left to oppose him; but \n",
      "he was also convinced that  there were no political \n",
      "difficulties in Europe and no real war, but only a sort of \n",
      "puppet show at which the men of the day were playing, \n",
      "pretending to do something real. Prince Andrew gaily \n",
      "bore with his father’s ridicu le of the new men, and drew \n",
      "him on and listened to him with evident pleasure. \n",
      "‘The past always seems good,’ said he, ‘but did not \n",
      "Suvorov himself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from \n",
      "which he did not know how to escape?’ \n",
      "‘Who told you that? Who? ’ cried the prince. \n",
      "‘Suvorov!’ And he jerked aw ay his plate, which Tikhon \n",
      "briskly caught. ‘Suvorov!... Consider, Prince Andrew. \n",
      "Two... Frederick and Suvorov; Moreau!... Moreau would \n",
      "have been a prisoner if Suvorov had had a free hand; but \n",
      "he had the Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands. \n",
      "It would have puzzled the devil himself! When you get \n",
      "there you’ll find out what th ose Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths War and Peace  \n",
      "228 of 2882 \n",
      "are! Suvorov couldn’t manage  them so what chance has \n",
      "Michael Kutuzov? No, my dear boy,’ he continued, ‘you \n",
      "and your generals won’t get on against Buonaparte; you’ll \n",
      "have to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may \n",
      "fight together. The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New \n",
      "York in America, to fetch the Frenchman, Moreau,’ he \n",
      "said, alluding to the invitation made that year to Moreau \n",
      "to enter the Russian service.... ‘Wonderful!... Were the \n",
      "Potemkins, Suvorovs, and Orlovs Germans? No, lad, \n",
      "either you fellows have all lo st your wits, or I have \n",
      "outlived mine. May God help you, but we’ll see what will \n",
      "happen. Buonaparte has b ecome a great commander \n",
      "among them! Hm!..’ \n",
      "‘I don’t at all say that all the plans are good,’ said \n",
      "Prince Andrew, ‘I am only surprised at your opinion of \n",
      "Bonaparte. You may laugh as much as you like, but all \n",
      "the same Bonaparte is a great generall.’ \n",
      "‘Michael Ivanovich!’ crie d the old prince to the \n",
      "architect who, busy with his roast meat, hoped he had \n",
      "been forgotten: ‘Didn’t I tell you Buonaparte was a great \n",
      "tactician? Here, he says same thing.’ \n",
      "‘To be sure, your excellency.’ replied the architect. \n",
      "The prince again laughed his frigid laugh. \n",

      "‘Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. \n",

      "the Germans. They beat no one- except one another. He \n",
      "made his reputation fighting them.’ \n",
      "And the prince began explaining all the blunders \n",
      "which, according to him, Bonaparte had made in his \n",
      "campaigns and even in politics. His son made no \n",
      "rejoinder, but it was eviden t that whatever arguments \n",
      "were presented he was as little able as his father to change \n",

      "In October, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the \n",
      "villages and towns of the Ar chduchy of Austria, and yet \n",
      "other regiments freshly arriving from Russia were settling \n",
      "near the fortress of Braunau and burdening the inhabitants \n",
      "on whom they were quartered. Braunau was the \n",
      "headquarters of the commander-in-chief, Kutuzov. \n",
      "On October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments \n",
      "that had just reached Braunau had halted half a mile from \n",
      "the town, waiting to be inspected by the commander in \n",
      "chief. Despite the un-Russian appearance of the locality \n",
      "and surroundings- fruit gardens, stone fences, tiled roofs, \n",
      "and hills in the distance- and despite the fact that the \n",
      "inhabitants (who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were \n",
      "not Russians, the regiment ha d just the appearance of any \n",
      "Russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in \n",
      "the heart of Russia. \n",
      "On the evening of the last day’s march an order had \n",
      "been received that the commander in chief would inspect \n",
      "the regiment on the march. Though the words of the order \n",
      "were not clear to the regimental commander, and the \n",
      "question arose whether the troops  were to be in marching \n",
      "order or not, it was decided at a consultation between the \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "249 of 2882 \n",
      "battalion commanders to presen t the regiment in parade \n",
      "order, on the principle that it is always better to ‘bow too \n",
      "low than not bow low enough.’ So the soldie rs, after a \n",
      "twenty-mile march, were kept mending and cleaning all \n",
      "night long without closing thei r eyes, while the adjutants \n",
      "and company commanders calc ulated and reckoned, and \n",
      "by morning the regiment- in stead of the straggling, \n",
      "disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day \n",
      "before- presented a well-orde red array of two thousand \n",
      "men each of whom knew his place and his duty, had every \n",
      "button and every strap in place, and shone with \n",
      "cleanliness. And not only extern ally was all in order, but \n",
      "had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the \n",
      "uniforms he would have found on every man a clean shirt, \n",
      "and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles, \n",
      "‘awl, soap, and all,’ as the soldiers say. There was only \n",
      "one circumstance concerning which no one could be at \n",
      "ease. It was the state of the soldiers’ boots. More than half \n",
      "the men’s boots were in holes. But this defect was not due \n",
      "to any fault of the regimental commander, for in spite of \n",
      "repeated demands boots had not been issued by the \n",
      "Austrian commissariat, and the regiment had marched \n",
      "some seven hundred miles. War and Peace  \n",
      "250 of 2882 \n",
      "The commander of the regiment was an elderly, \n",
      "choleric, stout, and thick-se t general with grizzled \n",
      "eyebrows and whiskers, and wider from chest to back \n",
      "than across the shoulders. He had on a brand-new uniform \n",
      "showing the creases where it had been folded and thick \n",
      "gold epaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie \n",
      "down on his massive shoulders. He had the air of a man \n",
      "happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his \n",
      "life. He walked about in front of the line and at every step \n",
      "pulled himself up, slightly arch ing his back. It was plain \n",
      "that the commander admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, \n",
      "and that his whole mind was e ngrossed by it, yet his strut \n",
      "seemed to indicate that, besides military matters, social \n",
      "interests and the fair sex o ccupied no small part of his \n",
      "thoughts. \n",
      "‘Well, Michael Mitrich, sir?’ he said, addressing one of \n",
      "the battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward \n",
      "(it was plain that they both felt happy). ‘We had our hands \n",
      "full last night. However, I think the regiment is not a bad \n",
      "one, eh?’ \n",
      "The battalion commander pe rceived the jovial irony \n",
      "and laughed. \n",
      "‘It would not be turned off the field even on the \n",
      "Tsaritsin Meadow.’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "251 of 2882 \n",
      "‘What?’ asked the commander. \n",
      "At that moment, on the road from the town on which \n",
      "signalers had been posted, two men appeared on horse \n",
      "back. They were an aide-decamp followed by a Cossack. \n",
      "The aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which \n",
      "had not been clearly worded the day before, namely, that \n",
      "the commander in chief wished to see the regiment just in \n",
      "the state in which it had been on the march: in their \n",
      "greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation \n",
      "whatever. \n",
      "A member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come \n",
      "to Kutuzov the day before with proposals and demands \n",
      "for him to join up with the army of the Archduke \n",
      "Ferdinand and Mack, and Kutuzov, not considering this \n",
      "junction advisable, meant, among other arguments in \n",
      "support of his view, to show  the Austrian general the \n",
      "wretched state in which the troops arrived from Russia. \n",
      "With this object he intended to meet the regiment; so the \n",
      "worse the condition it was in , the better pleased the \n",
      "commander in chief would be . Though the aide-de-camp \n",
      "did not know these circum stances, he nevertheless \n",
      "delivered the definite order that the men should be in their \n",
      "greatcoats and in marching order, and that the commander \n",
      "in chief would otherwise be di ssatisfied. On hearing this War and Peace  \n",
      "252 of 2882 \n",
      "the regimental commander hung his head, silently \n",
      "shrugged his shoulders, and sp read out his arms with a \n",
      "choleric gesture. \n",
      "‘A fine mess we’ve made of it!’ he remarked. \n",
      "‘There now! Didn’t I tell you, Michael Mitrich, that if \n",
      "it was said ‘on the march’ it meant in greatcoats?’ said he \n",
      "reproachfully to the battalion commander. ‘Oh, my God!’ \n",
      "he added, stepping reso lutely forward. ‘Company \n",
      "commanders!’ he shouted in a voice accustomed to \n",
      "command. ‘Sergeants major!... How soon will he be \n",
      "here?’ he asked the aide-d e-camp with a respectful \n",
      "politeness evidently relating to the personage he was \n",
      "referring to. \n",
      "‘In an hour’s time, I should say.’ \n",
      "‘Shall we have time to change clothes?’ \n",
      "‘I don’t know, General...’ \n",
      "The regimental commander, going up to the line \n",
      "himself, ordered the soldiers to change into their \n",
      "greatcoats. The company commanders ran off to their \n",
      "companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the \n",
      "greatcoats were not in very  good condition), and instantly \n",
      "the squares that had up to then  been in regular order and \n",
      "silent began to sway and st retch and hum with voices. On \n",
      "all sides soldiers were r unning to and fro, throwing up \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "253 of 2882 \n",
      "their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling \n",
      "the straps over their heads, unstrapping their overcoats \n",
      "and drawing the sleeves on with upraised arms. \n",
      "In half an hour all was agai n in order, only the squares \n",
      "had become gray instead of black. The regimental \n",
      "commander walked with his jerky steps to the front of the \n",
      "regiment and examined it from a distance. \n",
      "‘Whatever is this? This!’ he  shouted and stood still. \n",
      "‘Commander of the third company!’ \n",
      "‘Commander of the third company wanted by the \n",
      "general!... commander to the general... third company to \n",
      "the commander.’ The words passed along the lines and an \n",
      "adjutant ran to look for the missing officer. \n",
      "When the eager but misrepeated words had reached \n",
      "their destination in a cry of : ‘The general to the third \n",
      "company,’ the missing officer appeared from behind his \n",
      "company and, though he was a middle-aged man and not \n",
      "in the habit of running, tr otted awkwardly stumbling on \n",
      "his toes toward the general. The captain’s face showed the \n",
      "uneasiness of a schoolboy who is  told to repeat a lesson \n",
      "he has not learned. Spots appeared on his nose, the \n",
      "redness of which was evidently due to intemperance, and \n",
      "his mouth twitched nervously. The general looked the War and Peace  \n",
      "254 of 2882 \n",
      "captain up and down as he came up panting, slackening \n",
      "his pace as he approached. \n",
      "‘You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! \n",
      "What is this?’ shouted the regimental commander, \n",
      "thrusting forward his jaw and pointing at a soldier in the \n",
      "ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish cloth, \n",
      "which contrasted with the others. ‘What have you been \n",
      "after? The commander in chief is expected and you leave \n",
      "your place? Eh? I’ll teach you to dress the men in fancy \n",
      "coats for a parade.... Eh...?’ \n",
      "The commander of the compa ny, with his eyes fixed \n",
      "on his superior, pressed two fingers more and more \n",
      "rigidly to his cap, as if in this pressure lay his only hope \n",
      "of salvation. \n",
      "‘Well, why don’t you speak? Whom have you got \n",
      "there dressed up as a Hunga rian?’ said the commander \n",
      "with an austere gibe. \n",
      "‘Your excellency..’ \n",
      "‘Well, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But \n",
      "what about your excellency?... nobody knows.’ \n",
      "‘Your excellency, it’s the officer Dolokhov, who has \n",
      "been reduced to the ranks,’ said the captain softly. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "255 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Well? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or \n",
      "into a soldier? If a soldier, he should be dressed in \n",
      "regulation uniform like the others.’ \n",
      "‘Your excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the \n",
      "march.’ \n",
      "‘Gave him leave? Leave? Th at’s just like you young \n",
      "men,’ said the regimental commander cooling down a \n",
      "little. ‘Leave indeed.... One says a word to you and you... \n",
      "What?’ he added with rene wed irritation, ‘I beg you to \n",
      "dress your men decently.’ \n",
      "And the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, \n",
      "directed his jerky steps down the line. He was evidently \n",
      "pleased at his own display of  anger and walking up to the \n",
      "regiment wished to find a further excuse for wrath. \n",
      "Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge, at \n",
      "another because his line was not straight, he reached the \n",
      "third company. \n",
      "‘H-o-o-w are you standing? Where’s your leg? Your \n",
      "leg?’ shouted the commander wi th a tone of suffering in \n",
      "his voice, while there were still five men between him and \n",
      "Dolokhov with his bluish-gray uniform. \n",
      "Dolokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking \n",
      "straight with his clear, insolent eyes in the general’s face. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "256 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Why a blue coat? Off w ith it... Sergeant major! \n",
      "Change his coat... the ras...’ he did not finish. \n",
      "‘General, I must obey orde rs, but I am not bound to \n",
      "endure...’ Dolokhov hurriedly interrupted. \n",
      "‘No talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!’ \n",
      "‘Not bound to endure insults,’ Dolokhov concluded in \n",
      "loud, ringing tones. \n",
      "The eyes of the general and the soldier met. The \n",
      "general became silent, angrily pulling down his tight \n",
      "scarf. \n",
      "‘I request you to have th e goodness to change your \n",
      "coat,’ he said as he turned away. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "257 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter II \n",
      "‘He’s coming!’ shouted the signaler at that moment. \n",
      "The regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, \n",
      "seized the stirrup with trembling hands, threw his body \n",
      "across the saddle, righted hims elf, drew his saber, and \n",
      "with a happy and resolute countenance, opening his \n",
      "mouth awry, prepared to shout. The regiment fluttered \n",
      "like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless. \n",
      "‘Att-ention!’ shouted the re gimental commander in a \n",
      "soul-shaking voice which e xpressed joy for himself, \n",
      "severity for the regiment, and welcome for the \n",
      "approaching chief. \n",
      "Along the broad country roa d, edged on both sides by \n",
      "trees, came a high, light blue Vi ennese caleche, slightly \n",
      "creaking on its springs and drawn by six horses at a smart \n",
      "trot. Behind the caleche ga lloped the suite and a convoy \n",
      "of Croats. Beside Kutuzov sat an Austrian general, in a \n",
      "white uniform that looked strange among the Russian \n",
      "black ones. The caleche stopped in front of the regiment. \n",
      "Kutuzov and the Austrian ge neral were talking in low \n",
      "voices and Kutuzov smiled slight ly as treading heavily he \n",
      "stepped down from the carriage just as if those two War and Peace  \n",
      "258 of 2882 \n",
      "thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the \n",
      "regimental commander did not exist. \n",
      "The word of command rang out, and again the \n",
      "regiment quivered, as with a jingling sound it presented \n",
      "arms. Then amidst a dead silence the feeble voice of the \n",
      "commander in chief was heard. The regiment roared, \n",
      "‘Health to your ex... len... le n... lency!’ and again all \n",
      "became silent. At first Kutuzov stood still while the \n",
      "regiment moved; then he and the general in white, \n",
      "accompanied by the suite, walked between the ranks. \n",
      "From the way the regimental commander saluted the \n",
      "commander in chief and devoured him with his eyes, \n",
      "drawing himself up obsequious ly, and from the way he \n",
      "walked through the ranks behind the generals, bending \n",
      "forward and hardly able to re strain his jerky movements, \n",
      "and from the way he darted forward at every word or \n",
      "gesture of the commander in chief, it was evident that he \n",
      "performed his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal \n",
      "than his duty as a commander. Thanks to the strictness \n",
      "and assiduity of its commander the regiment, in \n",
      "comparison with others that had reached Braunau at the \n",
      "same time, was in splendid condition. There were only \n",
      "217 sick and stragglers. Ever ything was in good order \n",
      "except the boots. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "259 of 2882 \n",
      "Kutuzov walked through the ranks, sometimes \n",
      "stopping to say a few friendly words to officers he had \n",
      "known in the Turkish war, some times also to the soldiers. \n",
      "Looking at their boots he se veral times shook his head \n",
      "sadly, pointing them out to th e Austrian general with an \n",
      "expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming \n",
      "anyone, but could not help not icing what a bad state of \n",
      "things it was. The regimental commander ran forward on \n",
      "each such occasion, fearing to miss a single word of the \n",
      "commander in chief’s regard ing the regiment. Behind \n",
      "Kutuzov, at a distance that allowed every softly spoken \n",
      "word to be heard, followed some twenty men of his suite. \n",
      "These gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes \n",
      "laughed. Nearest of all to the commander in chief walked \n",
      "a handsome adjutant. This was Prince Bolkonski. Beside \n",
      "him was his comrade Nesvits ki, a tall staff officer, \n",
      "extremely stout, with a kindly, smiling, handsome face \n",
      "and moist eyes. Nesvitski could hardly keep from laughter \n",
      "provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside \n",
      "him. This hussar, with a grave face and without a smile or \n",
      "a change in the expression of his fixed eyes, watched the \n",
      "regimental commander’s back and mimicked his every \n",
      "movement. Each time the co mmander started and bent \n",
      "forward, the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the War and Peace  \n",
      "260 of 2882 \n",
      "same manner. Nesvitski laughed and nudged the others to \n",
      "make them look at the wag. \n",
      "Kutuzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands \n",
      "of eyes which were starting from their sockets to watch \n",
      "their chief. On reaching the third company he suddenly \n",
      "stopped. His suite, not having e xpected this, involuntarily \n",
      "came closer to him. \n",
      "‘Ah, Timokhin!’ said he, recognizing the red-nosed \n",
      "captain who had been reprimanded on account of the blue \n",
      "greatcoat. \n",
      "One would have thought it impossible for a man to \n",
      "stretch himself more than Timokhin had done when he \n",
      "was reprimanded by the regimental commander, but now \n",
      "that the commander in chie f addressed him he drew \n",
      "himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not \n",
      "have sustained it had the commander in chief continued to \n",
      "look at him, and so Kutuz ov, who evidently understood \n",
      "his case and wished him nothing but good, quickly turned \n",
      "away, a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his scarred \n",
      "and puffy face. \n",
      "‘Another Ismail comrade,’ said he. ‘A brave officer! \n",
      "Are you satisfied with him?’ he asked the regimental \n",
      "commander. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "261 of 2882 \n",
      "And the latter- unconscious that he was being reflected \n",
      "in the hussar officer as in a looking glass- started, moved \n",
      "forward, and answered: ‘Highly satisfied, your \n",
      "excellency!’ \n",
      "‘We all have our weaknesses,’ said Kutuzov smiling \n",
      "and walking away from him. ‘He used to have a \n",
      "predilection for Bacchus.’ \n",
      "The regimental commander was afraid he might be \n",
      "blamed for this and did not answer. The hussar at that \n",
      "moment noticed the face of the red-nosed captain and his \n",
      "drawn-in stomach, and mimicked his expression and pose \n",
      "with such exactitude that Nesvitski could not help \n",
      "laughing. Kutuzov turned round. The officer evidently \n",
      "had complete control of his face, and while Kutuzov was \n",
      "turning managed to make a grimace and then assume a \n",
      "most serious, deferential, and innocent expression. \n",
      "The third company was the last, and Kutuzov \n",
      "pondered, apparently trying to recollect something. Prince \n",
      "Andrew stepped forward from among the suite and said in \n",
      "French: \n",
      "‘You told me to remind you of the officer Dolokhov, \n",
      "reduced to the ranks in this regiment.’ \n",
      "‘Where is Dolokhov?’ asked Kutuzov. War and Peace  \n",
      "262 of 2882 \n",
      "Dolokhov, who had already changed into a soldier’s \n",
      "gray greatcoat, did not wa it to be called. The shapely \n",
      "figure of the fair-haired soldie r, with his clear blue eyes, \n",
      "stepped forward from the ranks, went up to the \n",
      "commander in chief, and presented arms. \n",
      "‘Have you a complaint to make?’ Kutuzov asked with \n",
      "a slight frown. \n",
      "‘This is Dolokhov,’ said Prince Andrew. \n",
      "‘Ah!’ said Kutuzov. ‘I hope this will be a lesson to \n",
      "you. Do your duty. The Emperor is gracious, and I shan’t \n",
      "forget you if you deserve well.’ \n",
      "The clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief \n",
      "just as boldly as they ha d looked at the regimental \n",
      "commander, seeming by their ex pression to tear open the \n",
      "veil of convention that separates a commander in chief so \n",
      "widely from a private. \n",
      "‘One thing I ask of your excellency,’ Dolokhov said in \n",
      "his firm, ringing, deliberate voice. ‘I ask an opportunity to \n",
      "atone for my fault and prove my devotion to His Majesty \n",
      "the Emperor and to Russia!’ \n",

      "he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible \n",
      "but precious object above hi s head and, holding it there \n",
      "for some seconds, suddenly flung it down and began: \n",
      "‘Oh, my bower, oh, my bower...!’ \n",
      "‘Oh, my bower new...!’ chimed in twenty voices, and \n",
      "the castanet player, in sp ite of the burden of his \n",
      "equipment, rushed out to the front and, walking \n",
      "backwards before the company, jerked his shoulders and \n",
      "flourished his castanets as if threatening someone. The \n",
      "soldiers, swinging their arms and keeping time \n",
      "spontaneously, marched with  long steps. Behind the \n",
      "company the sound of wheels,  the creaking of springs, \n",
      "and the tramp of horses’ hoofs were heard. Kutuzov and \n",
      "his suite were returning to the town. The commander in \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "268 of 2882 \n",
      "chief made a sign that the men should continue to march \n",
      "at ease, and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the \n",
      "sound of the singing and the si ght of the dancing soldier \n",
      "and the gay and smartly marc hing men. In the second file \n",
      "from the right flank, beside which the carriage passed the \n",
      "company, a blue-eyed soldie r involuntarily attracted \n",
      "notice. It was Dolokhov marchi ng with particular grace \n",
      "and boldness in time to the song and looking at those \n",
      "driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that \n",
      "moment marching with the company. The hussar cornet \n",
      "of Kutuzov’s suite who had mimicked the regimental \n",

      "Dolokhov. \n",
      "Hussar cornet Zherkov had at  one time, in Petersburg, \n",
      "belonged to the wild set led by Dolokhov. Zherkov had \n",
      "met Dolokhov abroad as a priv ate and had not seen fit to \n",
      "recognize him. But now that Kutuzov had spoken to the \n",
      "gentleman ranker, he addressed him with the cordiality of \n",
      "an old friend. \n",
      "‘My dear fellow, how are you?’ said he through the \n",
      "singing, making his horse keep pace with the company. \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "269 of 2882 \n",
      "The lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free \n",

      "intentional coldness of Dolokhov’s reply. \n",
      "‘And how do you get on with  the officers?’ inquired \n",
      "Zherkov. \n",
      "‘All right. They are good fellows. And how have you \n",
      "wriggled onto the staff?’ \n",
      "‘I was attached; I’m on duty.’ \n",
      "Both were silent. \n",
      "‘She let the hawk fly upward from her wide right \n",
      "sleeve,’ went the song, arous ing an involuntary sensation \n",
      "of courage and cheerfulness.  Their conversation would \n",
      "probably have been different but for the effect of that \n",
      "song. \n",
      "‘Is it true that Austrians have been beaten?’ asked \n",
      "Dolokhov. \n",
      "‘The devil only knows! They say so.’ \n",
      "‘I’m glad,’ answered Dolokhov briefly and clearly, as \n",
      "the song demanded. \n",
      "‘I say, come round some evening and we’ll have a \n",
      "game of faro!’ said Zherkov. \n",

      "‘Well, that’s only till the first engagement.’ \n",

      "‘Well, never mind; I only..’ \n",
      "‘And I only..’ \n",

      "Zherkov touched his horse with the spurs; it pranced \n",
      "excitedly from foot to foot un certain with which to start, \n",

      "Chapter III \n",
      "On returning from the review, Kutuzov took the \n",
      "Austrian general into his pr ivate room and, calling his \n",
      "adjutant, asked for some papers relating to the condition \n",
      "of the troops on their arrival, and the letters that had come \n",
      "from the Archduke Ferdinand, who was in command of \n",
      "the advanced army. Prince Andrew Bolkonski came into \n",
      "the room with the required papers. Kutuzov and the \n",
      "Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath were sitting at the \n",
      "table on which a plan was spread out. \n",
      "‘Ah!...’ said Kutuzov glancing at Bolkonski as if by \n",
      "this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait, and \n",
      "he went on with the conversation in French. \n",
      "‘All I can say, General,’ said he with a pleasant \n",
      "elegance of expression and int onation that obliged one to \n",
      "listen to each deliberately spoken word. It was evident \n",
      "that Kutuzov himself listened with pleasure to his own \n",
      "voice. ‘All I can say, General, is that if the matter \n",
      "depended on my personal wishes, the will of His Majesty \n",
      "the Emperor Francis would have been fulfilled long ago. I \n",
      "should long ago have joined the archduke. And believe \n",
      "me on my honour that to me personally it would be a War and Peace  \n",
      "272 of 2882 \n",
      "pleasure to hand over the supreme command of the army \n",
      "into the hands of a better informed and more skillful \n",
      "general- of whom Austria has so many- and to lay down \n",
      "all this heavy responsibil ity. But circumstances are \n",
      "sometimes too strong for us, General.’ \n",
      "And Kutuzov smiled in a way that seemed to say, ‘You \n",
      "are quite at liberty not to believe me and I don’t even care \n",
      "whether you do or not, but you have no grounds for \n",
      "telling me so. And that is the whole point.’ \n",
      "The Austrian general looke d dissatisfied, but had no \n",
      "option but to reply in the same tone. \n",
      "‘On the contrary,’ he sai d, in a querulous and angry \n",
      "tone that contrasted with his flattering words, ‘on the \n",
      "contrary, your excellency’s participation in the common \n",
      "action is highly valued by Hi s Majesty; but we think the \n",
      "present delay is depriving the splendid Russian troops and \n",
      "their commander of the laurels they have been \n",
      "accustomed to win in their battles,’ he concluded his \n",
      "evidently prearranged sentence. \n",
      "Kutuzov bowed with the same smile. \n",
      "‘But that is my convic tion, and judging by the last \n",
      "letter with which His Hi ghness the Archduke Ferdinand \n",
      "has honored me, I imagine that  the Austrian troops, under \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "273 of 2882 \n",
      "by now already gained a deci sive victory and no longer \n",

      "The general frowned. Though there was no definite \n",
      "news of an Austrian defeat, there were many \n",
      "circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors that \n",
      "were afloat, and so Kutuzov’s suggestion of an Austrian \n",
      "victory sounded much like irony. But Kutuzov went on \n",
      "blandly smiling with the sa me expression, which seemed \n",
      "to say that he had a right to  suppose so. And, in fact, the \n",
      "last letter he had received from Mack’s army informed \n",
      "him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the \n",
      "army was very favorable. \n",
      "‘Give me that letter,’ said Kutuzov turning to Prince \n",
      "Andrew. ‘Please have a look at  it’- and Kutuzov with an \n",
      "ironical smile about the corners of his mouth read to the \n",
      "Austrian general the following passage, in German, from \n",
      "the Archduke Ferdinand’s letter: \n",
      "We have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy \n",
      "thousand men with which to at tack and defeat the enemy \n",
      "should he cross the Lech. Also, as we are masters of Ulm, \n",
      "we cannot be deprived of the advantage of commanding \n",
      "both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not \n",
      "cross the Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw ourselves \n",
      "on his line of communications , recross the river lower War and Peace  \n",
      "274 of 2882 \n",
      "down, and frustrate his intenti on should he try to direct \n",
      "his whole force against our faithful ally. We shall \n",
      "therefore confidently await the moment when the Imperial \n",
      "Russian army will be fully equipped, and shall then, in \n",
      "conjunction with it, easily fi nd a way to prepare for the \n",
      "enemy the fate he deserves. \n",
      "Kutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and \n",

      "‘But you know the wise maxim your excellency, \n",

      "gathered up the papers and with a bow to both, stepped \n",
      "softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room. \n",
      "Though not much time had passed since Prince \n",
      "Andrew had left Russia, he had changed greatly during \n",
      "that period. In the expression of his face, in his \n",
      "movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of his \n",
      "former affected languor and indolence. He now looked \n",
      "like a man who has time to think of the impression he \n",
      "makes on others, but is occu pied with agreeable and \n",
      "interesting work. His face e xpressed more satisfaction \n",
      "with himself and those around him, his smile and glance \n",
      "were brighter and more attractive. \n",
      "Kutuzov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, had \n",
      "received him very kindly, promised not to forget him, \n",
      "distinguished him above the other adjutants, and had \n",
      "taken him to Vienna and given him the more serious \n",

      "a minority, acknowledged him to be different from \n",
      "themselves and from everyone else, expected great things \n",
      "of him, listened to him, admired, and imitated him, and \n",
      "with them Prince Andrew was natural and pleasant. \n",
      "Others, the majority, dislik ed him and considered him \n",
      "conceited, cold, and disagreeable. But among these people \n",

      "there. \n",
      "‘Dear me, can I have forgotten? No, I remember \n",
      "thinking that you kept it under your head like a treasure,’ \n",

      "Lavrushka turned all the bedding over, looked under \n",

      "stood still in the middle of the room. Denisov silently \n",

      "‘Wostov, you’ve not been playing schoolboy twicks..’ \n",

      "purse isn’t found I’ll flog you, I’ll flog you all.’ \n",
      "Rostov, his eyes avoiding De nisov, began buttoning \n",

      "understanding what Rostov hinted at, seized his arm. \n",
      "‘Nonsense!’ he cried, and the veins on his forehead \n",

      "He could not finish, and ran out of the room. \n",
      "‘Ah, may the devil take you and evewybody,’ were the \n",
      "last words Rostov heard. War and Peace  \n",
      "296 of 2882 \n",
      "Rostov went to Telyanin’s quarters. \n",
      "‘The master is not in, he’s gone to headquarters,’ said \n",

      "‘No, nothing.’ \n",
      "‘You’ve only just missed him,’ said the orderly. \n",
      "The headquarters were situ ated two miles away from \n",
      "Salzeneck, and Rostov, without  returning home, took a \n",
      "horse and rode there. There was an inn in the village \n",
      "which the officers frequented. Rostov rode up to it and \n",
      "saw Telyanin’s horse at the porch. \n",
      "In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting \n",
      "over a dish of sausages and a bottle of wine. \n",
      "‘Ah, you’ve come here too, young man!’ he said, \n",
      "smiling and raising his eyebrows. \n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Rostov as if it cost him a great deal to utter \n",
      "the word; and he sat down at the nearest table. \n",
      "Both were silent. There were two Germans and a \n",
      "Russian officer in the room. No one spoke and the only \n",
      "sounds heard were the clatter of knives and the munching \n",
      "of the lieutenant. \n",
      "When Telyanin had finished  his lunch he took out of \n",
      "his pocket a double purse and, drawing its rings aside \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "297 of 2882 \n",
      "with his small, white, turned-up fingers, drew out a gold \n",
      "imperial, and lifting his eyebrows gave it to the waiter. \n",
      "‘Please be quick,’ he said. \n",
      "The coin was a new one. Rostov rose and went up to \n",
      "Telyanin. \n",
      "‘Allow me to look at your purse,’ he said in a low, \n",
      "almost inaudible, voice. \n",
      "With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, Telyanin \n",
      "handed him the purse. \n",
      "‘Yes, it’s a nice purse. Ye s, yes,’ he said, growing \n",
      "suddenly pale, and added, ‘Look at it, young man.’ \n",
      "Rostov took the purse in his hand, examined it and the \n",
      "money in it, and looked at Telyanin. The lieutenant was \n",
      "looking about in his usual way and suddenly seemed to \n",
      "grow very merry. \n",
      "‘If we get to Vienna I’ll get rid of it there but in these \n",
      "wretched little towns there’s nowhere to spend it,’ said he. \n",
      "‘Well, let me have it, young man, I’m going.’ \n",
      "Rostov did not speak. \n",
      "‘And you? Are you going to have lunch too? They feed \n",
      "you quite decently here,’ continued Telyanin. ‘Now then, \n",
      "let me have it.’ \n",
      "He stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse. \n",
      "Rostov let go of it. Telyanin  took the purse and began War and Peace  \n",
      "298 of 2882 \n",
      "carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding \n",
      "breeches, with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly \n",
      "open, as if to say, ‘Yes, yes, I am putting my purse in my \n",
      "pocket and that’s quite simple and is no else’s business.’ \n",
      "‘Well, young man?’ he said with a sigh, and from \n",
      "under his lifted brows he glanced into Rostov’s eyes. \n",
      "Some flash as of an electric spark shot from Telyanin’s \n",
      "eyes to Rostov’s and back, and back again and again in an \n",
      "instant. \n",
      "‘Come here,’ said Rostov, catching hold of Telyanin’s \n",
      "arm and almost dragging him to the window. ‘That money \n",
      "is Denisov’s; you took it...’  he whispered just above \n",
      "Telyanin’s ear. \n",
      "‘What? What? How dare you? What?’ said Telyanin. \n",
      "But these words came like a piteous, despairing cry \n",
      "and an entreaty for pardon. As soon as Rostov heard \n",
      "them, an enormous load of doubt fell from him. He was \n",
      "glad, and at the same instant began to pity the miserable \n",
      "man who stood before him, but the task he had begun had \n",
      "to be completed. \n",
      "‘Heaven only knows what the people here may \n",
      "imagine,’ muttered Telyanin, taking up his cap and \n",
      "moving toward a small empty room. ‘We must have an \n",

      "Every muscle of Telyanin’s pale, terrified face began \n",
      "to quiver, his eyes still shifted from side to side but with a \n",
      "downward look not rising to Rostov’s face, and his sobs \n",
      "were audible. \n",
      "‘Count!... Don’t ruin a young fellow... here is this \n",
      "wretched money, take it...’ He  threw it on the table. ‘I \n",
      "have an old father and mother!..’ \n",
      "Rostov took the money, avoiding Telyanin’s eyes, and \n",
      "went out of the room without  a word. But at the door he \n",
      "stopped and then retraced his st eps. ‘O God,’ he said with \n",
      "tears in his eyes, ‘how could you do it?’ \n",
      "‘Count...’ said Telyanin drawing nearer to him. \n",
      "‘Don’t touch me,’ said Rostov, drawing back. ‘If you \n",

      "That same evening there was an animated discussion \n",
      "among the squadron’s officers in Denisov’s quarters. \n",
      "‘And I tell you, Rostov, that you must apologize to the \n",
      "colonel!’ said a tall, grizzl y-haired staff captain, with \n",
      "enormous mustaches and ma ny wrinkles on his large \n",
      "features, to Rostov who was crimson with excitement. \n",
      "The staff captain, Kirsten, had twice been reduced to \n",

      "commission. \n",
      "‘I will allow no one to call me a liar!’ cried Rostov. \n",
      "‘He told me I lied, and I told him he lied. And there it \n",
      "rests. He may keep me on duty every day, or may place \n",
      "me under arrest, but no one can make me apologize, \n",
      "because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it \n",
      "beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, then..’ \n",
      "‘You just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen,’ \n",
      "interrupted the staff captai n in his deep bass, calmly \n",
      "stroking his long mustache. ‘You tell the colonel in the \n",
      "presence of other officers that an officer has stolen..’ \n",
      "‘I’m not to blame that the conversation began in the \n",
      "presence of other officers. Perhaps I ought not to have \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "301 of 2882 \n",
      "spoken before them, but I am not a diplomatist. That’s \n",

      "give me satisfaction..’ \n",
      "‘That’s all right. No one thinks you a coward, but \n",
      "that’s not the point. Ask Denis ov whether it is not out of \n",
      "the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his \n",

      "Denisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening \n",
      "to the conversation, evidently with no wish to take part in \n",

      "disapproving shake of his head. \n",
      "‘You speak to the colonel a bout this nasty business \n",

      "‘I did not expect this of you,’ said the staff captain \n",
      "seriously and severely. ‘You don’t wish to apologize, but, \n",

      "302 of 2882 \n",
      "us- you’re to blame all round. The case is this: you ought \n",
      "to have thought the matter over and taken advice; but no, \n",
      "you go and blurt it all straight  out before the officers. \n",
      "Now what was the colonel to do? Have the officer tried \n",
      "and disgrace the whole regiment? Disgrace the whole \n",
      "regiment because of one scoundrel? Is that how you look \n",
      "at it? We don’t see it like  that. And Bogdanich was a \n",
      "brick: he told you you were saying what was not true. It’s \n",
      "not pleasant, but what’s to be done, my dear fellow? You \n",
      "landed yourself in it. And now, when one wants to smooth \n",
      "the thing over, some conceit prevents your apologizing, \n",
      "and you wish to make the whole affair public. You are \n",
      "offended at being put on duty a bit, but why not apologize \n",
      "to an old and honorable o fficer? Whatever Bogdanich \n",
      "may be, anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel! \n",
      "You’re quick at taking offense, but you don’t mind \n",

      "began to tremble. ‘You have been in the regiment next to \n",
      "no time, my lad, you’re here today and tomorrow you’ll \n",
      "be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your \n",
      "fingers when it is said ‘There are thieves among the \n",

      "something. They’ll ransack that castle,’ he remarked with \n",
      "evident approval. \n",
      "‘So they will,’ said Nesvitski. ‘No, but what I should \n",

      "He pointed with a smile to  a turreted nunnery, and his \n",

      "The officers laughed. \n",

      "‘Yes, so it is, so it is,’ said the general angrily, \n",
      "lowering the field glass and shrugging his shoulders, ‘so it \n",

      "smiling. \n",
      "‘Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?’ \n",
      "he said. \n",
      "‘It’s a bad business,’ sa id the general without \n",
      "answering him, ‘our men have been wasting time.’ \n",
      "‘Hadn’t I better ride over , your excellency?’ asked \n",
      "Nesvitski. \n",
      "‘Yes, please do,’ answered the general, and he repeated \n",
      "the order that had already once been given in detail: ‘and \n",
      "tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to fire the \n",
      "bridge as I ordered; and th e inflammable material on the \n",
      "bridge must be reinspected.’ \n",
      "‘Very good,’ answered Nesvitski. \n",
      "He called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put \n",
      "away the knapsack and flask, and swung his heavy person \n",
      "easily into the saddle. \n",
      "‘I’ll really call in on the nuns,’ he said to the officers \n",

      "‘Crew, to your guns!’ commanded the officer. \n",
      "In a moment the men came running gaily from their \n",

      "‘One!’ came the command. \n",
      "Number one jumped briskly aside. The gun rang out \n",
      "with a deafening metallic roar, and a whistling grenade \n",

      "Chapter VII \n",
      "Two of the enemy’s shots had already flown across the \n",
      "bridge, where there was a crush. Halfway across stood \n",
      "Prince Nesvitski, who had ali ghted from his horse and \n",
      "whose big body was body was jammed against the \n",
      "railings. He looked back la ughing to the Cossack who \n",
      "stood a few steps behind hi m holding two horses by their \n",
      "bridles. Each time Prince Nesvitski tried to move on, \n",
      "soldiers and carts pushed him back again and pressed him \n",
      "against the railings, and all he could do was to smile. \n",
      "‘What a fine fellow you are, friend!’ said the Cossack \n",
      "to a convoy soldie r with a wagon, who was pressing onto \n",
      "the infantrymen who were crow ded together close to his \n",
      "wheels and his horses. ‘What a fellow! You can’t wait a \n",
      "moment! Don’t you see the general wants to pass?’ \n",
      "But the convoyman took no notice of the word \n",
      "‘general’ and shouted at the soldiers who were blocking \n",
      "his way. ‘Hi there, boys! Keep to the left! Wait a bit.’ But \n",
      "the soldiers, crowded together shoulder to shoulder, their \n",
      "bayonets interlocking, moved ove r the bridge in a dense \n",
      "mass. Looking down over the rails Prince Nesvitski saw \n",
      "the rapid, noisy little waves of the Enns, which rippling War and Peace  \n",
      "312 of 2882 \n",
      "and eddying round the piles of  the bridge chased each \n",
      "other along. Looking on the bridge he saw equally \n",
      "uniform living waves of soldiers, shoulder straps, covered \n",
      "shakos, knapsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and, under the \n",
      "shakos, faces with broad cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and \n",
      "listless tired expressions, and feet that moved through the \n",
      "sticky mud that covered the planks of the bridge. \n",
      "Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men, like a \n",
      "fleck of white foam on the waves of the Enns, an officer, \n",
      "in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of \n",
      "the men, squeezed his way along; sometimes like a chip \n",
      "of wood whirling in the river, an hussar on foot, an \n",
      "orderly, or a townsman was carried through the waves of \n",
      "infantry; and sometimes like a log floating down the river, \n",
      "an officers’ or company’s baggage wagon, piled high, \n",
      "leather covered, and hemmed in on all sides, moved \n",
      "across the bridge. \n",
      "‘It’s as if a dam had burst,’ said the Cossack \n",
      "hopelessly. ‘Are there many more of you to come?’ \n",
      "‘A million all but one!’ replied a waggish soldier in a \n",
      "torn coat, with a wink, and passed on followed by \n",
      "another, an old man. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "313 of 2882 \n",
      "‘If he’ (he meant the enemy) ‘begins popping at the \n",

      "That soldier passed on, a nd after him came another \n",
      "sitting on a cart. \n",
      "‘Where the devil have the le g bands been shoved to?’ \n",
      "said an orderly, running behi nd the cart and fumbling in \n",

      "And he also passed on with the wagon. Then came \n",
      "some merry soldiers who had evidently been drinking. \n",
      "‘And then, old fellow, he gives him one in the teeth \n",
      "with the butt end of his gun...’  a soldier whose greatcoat \n",
      "was well tucked up said gaily, with a wide swing of his \n",
      "arm. \n",
      "‘Yes, the ham was just delic ious...’ answered another \n",
      "with a loud laugh. And they, too, passed on, so that \n",
      "Nesvitski did not learn who had been struck on the teeth, \n",
      "or what the ham had to do with it. \n",
      "‘Bah! How they scurry. He just sends a ball and they \n",
      "think they’ll all be killed,’ a sergeant was saying angrily \n",
      "and reproachfully. \n",
      "‘As it flies past me, Daddy, the ball I mean,’ said a \n",
      "young soldier with an enormous  mouth, hardly refraining \n",

      "314 of 2882 \n",
      "word, I got that frightened!’ said he, as if bragging of \n",
      "having been frightened. \n",
      "That one also passed. Then followed a cart unlike any \n",
      "that had gone before. It was a German cart with a pair of \n",
      "horses led by a German, and seemed loaded with a whole \n",
      "houseful of effects. A fine brindled cow with a large \n",
      "udder was attached to the ca rt behind. A woman with an \n",
      "unweaned baby, an old woman, and a healthy German girl \n",
      "with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds. \n",
      "Evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass by special \n",
      "permission. The eyes of all the soldiers turned toward the \n",
      "women, and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace all \n",
      "the soldiers’ remarks related to the two young ones. Every \n",
      "face bore almost the same smile, expressing unseemly \n",
      "thoughts about the women. \n",
      "‘Just see, the German sausage is making tracks, too!’ \n",
      "‘Sell me the missis,’ said another soldier, addressing \n",

      "The girl smiled and took it. Nesvitski like the rest of \n",
      "the men on the bridge did not take his eyes off the women \n",
      "till they had passed. When they had gone by, the same \n",
      "stream of soldiers followed, with the same kind of talk, \n",
      "and at last all stopped. As of ten happens, the horses of a \n",
      "convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge, \n",
      "and the whole crowd had to wait. \n",
      "‘And why are they stopping? There’s no proper order!’ \n",

      "Looking down at the waters  of the Enns under the \n",

      "there! get out of the way! Make way!’ \n",
      "With great difficulty he managed to get to his horse, \n",
      "and shouting continually he moved on. The soldiers \n",
      "squeezed themselves to make way for him, but again \n",
      "pressed on him so that they jammed his leg, and those \n",
      "nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves \n",
      "pressed still harder from behind. \n",
      "‘Nesvitski, Nesvitski! you numskull!’ came a hoarse \n",

      "‘The squadwon can’t pass,’ shouted Vaska Denisov, \n",
      "showing his white teeth fier cely and spurring his black \n",

      "The imposing figure of Nesvitski followed by his \n",

      "There was no one now between the squadron and the \n",

      "toward evening when he ha d emptied his second bottle; \n",
      "he was only redder than usual. With his shaggy head \n",
      "thrown back like birds when they drink, pressing his spurs \n",
      "mercilessly into the sides of his good horse, Bedouin, and \n",
      "sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle, he \n",
      "galloped to the other flank of  the squadron and shouted in \n",

      "The high-shouldered figure of Zherkov, familiar to the \n",

      "328 of 2882 \n",

      "Striking his horse with his l ong muscular legs as if it \n",

      "closely- to find in his face confirmation of his own \n",
      "conjecture, but the colonel di d not once glance at Rostov, \n",
      "and looked as he always did when at the front, solemn and \n",
      "stern. Then came the word of command. \n",
      "‘Look sharp! Look sharp!’ several voices repeated \n",
      "around him. \n",
      "Their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs \n",

      "what they were to do. The men were crossing themselves. \n",
      "Rostov no longer looked at th e colonel, he had no time. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "329 of 2882 \n",
      "He was afraid of falling behind the hussars, so much \n",
      "afraid that his heart stood still. His hand trembled as he \n",
      "gave his horse into an orderly’s charge, and he felt the \n",
      "blood rush to his heart with a thud. Denisov rode past \n",
      "him, leaning back and s houting something. Rostov saw \n",
      "nothing but the hussars running all around him, their spurs \n",
      "catching and their sabers clattering. \n",
      "‘Stretchers!’ shouted someone behind him. \n",
      "Rostov did not think what this call for stretchers \n",
      "meant; he ran on, trying only to  be ahead of the others; \n",
      "but just at the bridge, not looking at the ground, he came \n",
      "on some sticky, trodden mud, stumbled, and fell on his \n",
      "hands. The others outstripped him. \n",
      "‘At boss zides, Captain,’ he  heard the voice of the \n",

      "horse near the bridge, with a triumphant, cheerful face. \n",
      "Rostov wiping his muddy hands on his breeches \n",
      "looked at his enemy and was about to run on, thinking \n",
      "that the farther he went to the front the better. But \n",
      "Bogdanich, without looking at  or recognizing Rostov, \n",
      "shouted to him: \n",
      "‘Who’s that running on the middle of the bridge? To \n",
      "the right! Come back, Cade t!’ he cried angrily; and War and Peace  \n",
      "330 of 2882 \n",
      "turning to Denisov, who, show ing off his courage, had \n",
      "ridden on to the planks of the bridge: \n",

      "watching, now the small group of men with yellow \n",

      "then at what was approachi ng in the distance from the \n",

      "These were the questions each man of the troops on the \n",
      "high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself \n",
      "with a sinking heart- watching the bridge and the hussars \n",
      "in the bright evening light a nd the blue tunics advancing \n",
      "from the other side with their bayonets and guns. \n",
      "‘Ugh. The hussars will get it hot!’ said Nesvitski; ‘they \n",

      "‘He shouldn’t have taken so many men,’ said the \n",

      "‘True enough,’ answered Nesvitski; ‘two smart fellows \n",
      "could have done the job just as well.’ \n",
      "‘Ah, your excellency,’ put in Zherkov, his eyes fixed \n",
      "on the hussars, but still with that naive air that made it \n",
      "impossible to know whether he was speaking in jest or in \n",
      "earnest. ‘Ah, your excellen cy! How you look at things! \n",
      "Send two men? And who then would give us the Vladimir \n",
      "medal and ribbon? But now, even if they do get peppered, \n",
      "the squadron may be recommended for honors and he \n",
      "may get a ribbon. Our Bogdanich knows how things are \n",
      "done.’ \n",
      "‘There now!’ said the officer of the suite, ‘that’s \n",
      "grapeshot.’ \n",
      "He pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which \n",
      "were being detached and hurriedly removed. \n",
      "On the French side, amid the groups with cannon, a \n",
      "cloud of smoke appeared, th en a second and a third \n",
      "almost simultaneously, and at the moment when the first \n",
      "report was heard a fourth was seen. Then two reports one \n",
      "after another, and a third. War and Peace  \n",
      "332 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Oh! Oh!’ groaned Nesvitski as if in fierce pain, \n",
      "seizing the officer of the su ite by the arm. ‘Look! A man \n",
      "has fallen! Fallen, fallen!’ \n",
      "‘Two, I think.’ \n",
      "‘If I were Tsar I would never go to war,’ said \n",
      "Nesvitski, turning away. \n",
      "The French guns were hastily reloaded. The infantry in \n",
      "their blue uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run. \n",
      "Smoke appeared again but at irregular intervals, and \n",
      "grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the bridge. But this \n",
      "time Nesvitski could not see what was happening there, as \n",
      "a dense cloud of smoke arose from it. The hussars had \n",
      "succeeded in setting it on fire and the French batteries \n",
      "were now firing at them, no longer to hinder them but \n",
      "because the guns were trained and there was someone to \n",
      "fire at. \n",
      "The French had time to fire  three rounds of grapeshot \n",
      "before the hussars got back to their horses. Two were \n",
      "misdirected and the shot went  too high, but the last round \n",
      "fell in the midst of a group of hussars and knocked three \n",
      "of them over. \n",
      "Rostov, absorbed by his relations with Bogdanich, had \n",
      "paused on the bridge not knowing what to do. There was \n",
      "no one to hew down (as he had always imagined battles to \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "333 of 2882 \n",
      "himself), nor could he help to fire the bridge because he \n",
      "had not brought any burning straw with him like the other \n",
      "soldiers. He stood looking about  him, when suddenly he \n",
      "heard a rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt, and \n",
      "the hussar nearest to him fe ll against the rails with a \n",
      "groan. Rostov ran up to hi m with the others. Again \n",
      "someone shouted, ‘Stretcher s!’ Four men seized the \n",
      "hussar and began lifting him. \n",
      "‘Oooh! For Christ’s sake let me alone!’ cried the \n",
      "wounded man, but still he was lifted and laid on the \n",
      "stretcher. \n",
      "Nicholas Rostov turned away and, as if searching for \n",
      "something, gazed into the distance, at the waters of the \n",
      "Danube, at the sky, and at the sun. How beautiful the sky \n",
      "looked; how blue, how calm, and how deep! How bright \n",
      "and glorious was the setting s un! With what soft glitter \n",
      "the waters of the distant Da nube shone. And fairer still \n",
      "were the faraway blue mount ains beyond the river, the \n",
      "nunnery, the mysterious gorges, and the pine forests \n",
      "veiled in the mist of their summits... There was peace and \n",
      "happiness... ‘I should wishing for nothing else, nothing, if \n",
      "only I were there,’ thought Ro stov. ‘In myself alone and \n",
      "in that sunshine there is so much happiness; but here... \n",

      "There- they are shouting ag ain, and again are all running \n",
      "back somewhere, and I shall run with them, and it, death, \n",
      "is here above me and around... Another instant and I shall \n",
      "never again see the sun, this water, that gorge!..’ \n",
      "At that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds, \n",
      "and other stretchers came into view before Rostov. And \n",
      "the fear of death and of the st retchers, and love of the sun \n",
      "and of life, all merged into one feeling of sickening \n",
      "agitation. \n",
      "‘O Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, \n",
      "forgive, and protect me!’ Rostov whispered. \n",
      "The hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; \n",
      "their voices sounded louder an d calmer, the stretchers \n",
      "disappeared from sight. \n",
      "‘Well, fwiend? So you’ve  smelt powdah!’ shouted \n",
      "Vaska Denisov just above his ear. \n",
      "‘It’s all over; but I am a coward- yes, a coward!’ \n",
      "thought Rostov, and sighing deeply he took Rook, his \n",
      "horse, which stood resting one foot, from the orderly and \n",
      "began to mount. \n",
      "‘Was that grapeshot?’ he asked Denisov. \n",
      "‘Yes and no mistake!’ cried Denisov. ‘You worked \n",
      "like wegular bwicks and it’s nasty work! An attack’s \n",
      "pleasant work! Hacking away at  the dogs! But this sort of \n",

      "And Denisov rode up to a group that had stopped near \n",

      "the officer from the suite. \n",
      "‘Well, it seems that no one has noticed,’ thought \n",
      "Rostov. And this was true. No  one had taken any notice, \n",
      "for everyone knew the sensation which the cadet under \n",

      "‘Here’s something for you to report,’ said Zherkov. \n",
      "‘See if I don’t get promoted to a sublieutenancy.’ \n",

      "‘A trifle,’ said the colonel in his bass voice: ‘two \n",

      "population that was unfriendly to  it, losing confidence in \n",
      "its allies, suffering from shortness of supplies, and \n",
      "compelled to act under conditi ons of war unlike anything \n",
      "that had been foreseen, the Russian army of thirty-five \n",
      "thousand men commanded by Kutuzov was hurriedly \n",
      "retreating along the Danube, stopping where overtaken by \n",
      "the enemy and fighting rearguar d actions only as far as \n",
      "necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy \n",
      "equipment. There had been actions at Lambach, \n",
      "Amstetten, and Melk; but despite the courage and \n",
      "endurance- acknowledged even by the enemy- with which \n",
      "the Russians fought, the onl y consequence of these \n",

      "Braunau now separated from the Russian army, and \n",
      "Kutuzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted \n",

      "thought of. Instead of an offensive, the plan of which, \n",
      "carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "337 of 2882 \n",
      "strategics, had been handed to Kutuzov when he was in \n",
      "Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole and almost \n",
      "unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a \n",
      "junction with the forces that were advancing from Russia, \n",
      "without losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm. \n",
      "On the twenty-eighth of October Kutuzov with his \n",

      "For the first time, after a fortnight’s retreat, the Russian \n",

      "to start a conversation. \n",
      "‘Good news!... Go on!’ he shouted to the driver, and \n",

      "palace felt even more vigorous and alert than he had done \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "341 of 2882 \n",
      "the day before. Only his eyes gleamed feverishly and his \n",
      "thoughts followed one another with extraordinary \n",
      "clearness and rapidity. He again vividly recalled the \n",
      "details of the battle, no longer dim, but definite and in the \n",
      "concise form concise form in which he imagined himself \n",
      "stating them to the Emperor Francis. He vividly imagined \n",
      "the casual questions that might be put to him and the \n",
      "answers he would give. He expected to be at once \n",
      "presented to the Emperor. At the chief entrance to the \n",
      "palace, however, an official  came running out to meet \n",
      "him, and learning that he was a special messenger led him \n",
      "to another entrance. \n",
      "‘To the right from the corridor, Euer Hochgeboren! \n",
      "There you will find the adjutant on duty,’ said the official. \n",
      "‘He will conduct you to the Minister of War.’ \n",
      "The adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrew, asked \n",
      "him to wait, and went in to the Minister of War. Five \n",
      "minutes later he returned and bowing with particular \n",
      "courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before him along a \n",
      "corridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at \n",
      "work. The adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to \n",
      "wish to ward off any attempt at familiarity on the part of \n",
      "the Russian messenger. War and Peace  \n",
      "342 of 2882 \n",
      "Prince Andrew’s joyous feeling was considerably \n",
      "weakened as he approached the door of the minister’s \n",
      "room. He felt offended, and without his noticing it the \n",
      "feeling of offense immediately turned into one of disdain \n",
      "which was quite uncalled for. His fertile mind instantly \n",
      "suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right \n",
      "to despise the adjutant and the minister. ‘Away from the \n",
      "smell of powder, they proba bly think it easy to gain \n",
      "victories!’ he thought. His eyes narrowed disdainfully, he \n",
      "entered the room of the Minist er of War with peculiarly \n",
      "deliberate steps. This feeling of disdain was heightened \n",
      "when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading \n",
      "some papers and making pencil notes on them, and for the \n",
      "first two or three minutes taking no notice of his arrival. A \n",
      "wax candle stood at each side of  the minister’s bent bald \n",
      "head with its gray temples. He went on reading to the end, \n",
      "without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the \n",
      "sound of footsteps. \n",
      "‘Take this and deliver it,’ said he to his adjutant, \n",
      "handing him the papers and still taking no notice of the \n",
      "special messenger. \n",
      "Prince Andrew felt that eith er the actions of Kutuzov’s \n",
      "army interested the Minister of War less than any of the \n",
      "other matters he was concerned with, or he wanted to give \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",

      "is a matter of perfect indiffere nce to me,’ he thought. The \n",
      "minister drew the remaining papers together, arranged \n",
      "them evenly, and then raised his head. He had an \n",
      "intellectual and distinctive head, but the instant he turned \n",
      "to Prince Andrew the firm, intelligent expression on his \n",
      "face changed in a way evidently deliberate and habitual to \n",
      "him. His face took on the st upid artificial smile (which \n",
      "does not even attempt to hide  its artificiality) of a man \n",
      "who is continually receivi ng many petitioners one after \n",
      "another. \n",
      "‘From General Field Marshal Kutuzov?’ he asked. ‘I \n",
      "hope it is good news? There ha s been an encounter with \n",
      "Mortier? A victory? It was high time!’ \n",
      "He took the dispatch which was addressed to him and \n",
      "began to read it with a mournful expression. \n",
      "‘Oh, my God! My God! Schmidt!’ he exclaimed in \n",
      "German. ‘What a calamity! What a calamity!’ \n",
      "Having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the \n",
      "table and looked at Prince A ndrew, evidently considering \n",
      "something. \n",
      "‘Ah what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? \n",
      "But Mortier is not captured.’ Again he pondered. ‘I am \n",
      "very glad you have brou ght good news, though Schmidt’s War and Peace  \n",
      "344 of 2882 \n",
      "death is a heavy price to pay for the victory. His Majesty \n",
      "will no doubt wish to see you, but not today. I thank you! \n",
      "You must have a rest. Be at the levee tomorrow after the \n",
      "parade. However, I will let you know.’ \n",
      "The stupid smile, which had left his face while he was \n",
      "speaking, reappeared. \n",
      "‘Au revoir! Thank you very much. His Majesty will \n",
      "probably desire to see you,’ he added, bowing his head. \n",
      "When Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the \n",
      "interest and happiness the vi ctory had afforded him had \n",
      "been now left in the indiffere nt hands of the Minister of \n",
      "War and the polite adjutant . The whole tenor of his \n",
      "thoughts instantaneously changed; the battle seemed the \n",
      "memory of a remote event long past. \n",

      "Chapter X \n",
      "Prince Andrew stayed at Brunn with Bilibin, a Russian \n",
      "acquaintance of his in the diplomatic service. \n",
      "‘Ah, my dear prince! I could not have a more welcome \n",
      "visitor,’ said Bilibin as he came out to meet Prince \n",
      "Andrew. ‘Franz, put the prince ’s things in my bedroom,’ \n",
      "said he to the servant who was ushering Bolkonski in. ‘So \n",
      "you’re a messenger of victory, eh? Splendid! And I am \n",
      "sitting here ill, as you see.’ \n",
      "After washing and dressing, Prince Andrew came into \n",
      "the diplomat’s luxurious study and sat down to the dinner \n",
      "prepared for him. Bilibin settled down comfortably beside \n",
      "the fire. \n",
      "After his journey and the campaign during which he \n",
      "had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and \n",
      "all the refinements of life, Prince Andrew felt a pleasant \n",
      "sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such as he \n",
      "had been accustomed to from childhood. Besides it was \n",
      "pleasant, after his reception by the Austrians, to speak if \n",
      "not in Russian (for they were speaking French) at least \n",
      "with a Russian who would, he supposed, share the general War and Peace  \n",
      "346 of 2882 \n",
      "Russian antipathy to the Austrians which was then \n",
      "particularly strong. \n",
      "Bilibin was a man of thirty-five, a bachelor, and of the \n",
      "same circle as Prince Andrew. They had known each \n",
      "other previously in Peters burg, but had become more \n",
      "intimate when Prince Andrew was in Vienna with \n",
      "Kutuzov. Just as Prince Andrew was a young man who \n",
      "gave promise of rising high in the military profession, so \n",
      "to an even greater extent Bilibin gave promise of rising in \n",
      "his diplomatic career. He still a young man but no longer \n",
      "a young diplomat, as he had entered the service at the age \n",
      "of sixteen, had been in Pa ris and Copenhagen, and now \n",
      "held a rather important post in Vienna. Both the foreign \n",
      "minister and our ambassador in Vienna knew him and \n",
      "valued him. He was not one of those many diplomats who \n",
      "are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities, \n",
      "avoid doing certain things, and speak French. He was one \n",
      "of those, who, liking work, knew how to do it, and despite \n",
      "his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his \n",
      "writing table. He worked well whatever the import of his \n",
      "work. It was not the question ‘What for?’ but the question \n",
      "‘How?’ that interested him.  What the diplomatic matter \n",
      "might be he did not care, but it gave him great pleasure to \n",
      "prepare a circular, memorandum, or report, skillfully, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "347 of 2882 \n",
      "pointedly, and elegantly. Bilibin’s services were valued \n",
      "not only for what he wrote, but also for his skill in dealing \n",
      "and conversing with those in the highest spheres. \n",
      "Bilibin liked conversation as he liked work, only when \n",
      "it could be made elegantly witty. In society he always \n",
      "awaited an opportunity to say something striking and took \n",
      "part in a conversation only when that was possible. His \n",
      "conversation was always sprink led with witt ily original, \n",
      "finished phrases of general interest. These sayings were \n",
      "prepared in the inner laborat ory of his mind in a portable \n",
      "form as if intentionally, so that insignificant society \n",
      "people might carry them from drawing room to drawing \n",
      "room. And, in fact, Bilibin’s witticisms were hawked \n",
      "about in the Viennese drawing rooms and often had an \n",
      "influence on matters considered important. \n",
      "His thin, worn, sallow face was covered with deep \n",
      "wrinkles, which always looked as clean and well washed \n",
      "as the tips of one’s fingers  after a Russian bath. The \n",
      "movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of \n",
      "expression on his face. Now his forehead would pucker \n",
      "into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted, then his \n",
      "eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would crease \n",
      "his cheeks. His small, deep-set  eyes always twinkled and \n",

      "‘Well, now tell me about your exploits,’ said he. \n",

      "‘They received me and my news as one receives a dog \n",

      "‘And why didn’t you do it at seven in the morning? \n",

      "‘Why did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte \n",
      "by diplomatic methods that he had better leave Genoa \n",

      "‘I know,’ interrupted Bilibin, ‘you’re thinking it’s very \n",

      "‘Well, I think it is. The bigw igs here think so too, but \n",
      "they daren’t say so. It will be as I said at the beginning of \n",
      "the campaign, it won’t be your skirmishing at \n",
      "Durrenstein, or gunpowder at a ll, that will decide the \n",
      "matter, but those who devised it,’ said Bilibin quoting one \n",
      "of his own mots, releasing th e wrinkles on his forehead, \n",
      "and pausing. ‘The only question is what will come of the \n",

      "the new Campo Formio are to be drawn up.’ \n",
      "‘What an extraordinary genius!’ Prince Andrew \n",
      "suddenly exclaimed, clenching his small hand and striking \n",
      "the table with it, ‘and what luck the man has!’ \n",
      "‘Buonaparte?’ said Bilibin inquiringly, puckering up \n",
      "his forehead to indicate that he was about to say \n",
      "something witty. ‘Buonaparte?’ he repeated, accentuating \n",
      "the u: ‘I think, however, now that he lays down laws for \n",
      "Austria at Schonbrunn, il faut lui faire grace de l’u!* I \n",
      "shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply \n",
      "Bonaparte!’ \n",
      "*\"We must let him off the u!’ \n",

      "‘This is what I think. Austria has been made a fool of, \n",
      "and she is not used to it. She will retaliate. And she has \n",
      "been fooled in the first place because her provinces have \n",
      "been pillaged- they say the Holy Russian army loots \n",
      "terribly- her army is destr oyed, her capital taken, and all \n",
      "this for the beaux yeux* of His Sardinian Majesty. And \n",
      "therefore- this is between ourselves- I instinctively feel War and Peace  \n",
      "354 of 2882 \n",
      "that we are being deceived, my instinct tells me of \n",

      "becoming smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an \n",

      "When Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for \n",
      "him and lay down in a clean shirt on the feather bed with \n",
      "its warmed and fragrant pillows,  he felt that the battle of \n",

      "The alliance with Prussia, Austria’s treachery, \n",
      "Bonaparte’s new triumph, tomorrow’s levee and parade, \n",

      "He closed his eyes, and immediately a sound of \n",
      "cannonading, of musketry a nd the rattling of carriage \n",
      "wheels seemed to fill his ears, and now again drawn out in \n",
      "a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill, the \n",
      "French were firing, and he felt his heart palpitating as he \n",
      "rode forward beside Schmidt with the bullets merrily \n",

      "355 of 2882 \n",
      "whistling all around, and he experienced tenfold the joy of \n",
      "living, as he had not done since childhood. \n",
      "He woke up... \n",
      "‘Yes, that all happened!’ he said, and, smiling happily \n",
      "to himself like a child, he fell into a deep, youthful \n",
      "slumber. War and Peace  \n",

      "Chapter XI \n",
      "Next day he woke late. Recalling his recent \n",
      "impressions, the first thought that came into his mind was \n",
      "that today he had to be presented to the Emperor Francis; \n",
      "he remembered the Minister of War, the polite Austrian \n",
      "adjutant, Bilibin, and last ni ght’s conversation. Having \n",
      "dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform, \n",
      "which he had not worn for a long time, he went into \n",
      "Bilibin’s study fresh, animated, and handsome, with his \n",
      "hand bandaged. In the study were  four gentlemen of the \n",
      "diplomatic corps. With Prince Hippolyte Kuragin, who \n",
      "was a secretary to the embassy, Bolkonski was already \n",
      "acquainted. Bilibin introduced him to the others. \n",
      "The gentlemen assembled at Bilibin’s were young, \n",
      "wealthy, gay society men, who here, as in Vienna, formed \n",
      "a special set which Bilibin, their leader, called les notres.* \n",
      "This set, consisting almost exclusively of diplomats, \n",
      "evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do \n",
      "with war or politics but relate d to high society, to certain \n",
      "women, and to the official side of the service. These \n",
      "gentlemen received Prince Andr ew as one of themselves, \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "357 of 2882 \n",
      "and to start conversation, th ey asked him a few questions \n",

      "the figure he cut?..’ \n",
      "‘But the worst of it, gentlemen- I am giving Kuragin \n",
      "away to you- is that that ma n suffers, and this Don Juan, \n",
      "wicked fellow, is taking advantage of it!’ \n",
      "Prince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his \n",
      "legs over its arm. He began to laugh. \n",
      "‘Tell me about that!’ he said. \n",
      "‘Oh, you Don Juan! You serpent!’ cried several voices. \n",
      "‘You, Bolkonski, don’t know,’ said Bilibin turning to \n",
      "Prince Andrew, ‘that all the atrocities of the French army \n",

      "‘Oh, I must give you a treat,’ Bilibin whispered to \n",

      "He was evidently distressed, and breathed painfully, but \n",
      "could not restrain the wild laughter that convulsed his \n",
      "usually impassive features. \n",
      "‘Well now, gentlemen,’ said Bilibin, ‘Bolkonski is my \n",

      "attention when the officer arrived, but at a sign resumed \n",
      "his measured, monotonous p acing. Behind the guns were \n",
      "their limbers and still farther back picket ropes and \n",
      "artillerymen’s bonfires. To the left, not far from the \n",
      "farthest cannon, was a small, newly constructed wattle \n",
      "shed from which came the s ound of officers’ voices in \n",
      "eager conversation. \n",
      "It was true that a view ove r nearly the whole Russian \n",
      "position and the greater part of the enemy’s opened out \n",
      "from this battery. Just facing it, on the crest of the \n",
      "opposite hill, the village of Schon Grabern could be seen, \n",
      "and in three places to left  and right the French troops \n",
      "amid the smoke of their campf ires, the greater part of \n",
      "whom were evidently in the village itself and behind the \n",
      "hill. To the left from that  village, amid the smoke, was \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "400 of 2882 \n",
      "something resembling a battery, but it was impossible to \n",
      "see it clearly with the naked eye. Our right flank was \n",
      "posted on a rather steep in cline which dominated the \n",
      "French position. Our infantry we re stationed there, and at \n",
      "the farthest point the dra goons. In the center, where \n",
      "Tushin’s battery stood and from which Prince Andrew \n",
      "was surveying the position, was the easiest and most \n",
      "direct descent and ascent to th e brook separating us from \n",
      "Schon Grabern. On the left our  troops were close to a \n",
      "copse, in which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who \n",
      "were felling wood. The French line was wider than ours, \n",
      "and it was plain that they c ould easily outflank us on both \n",
      "sides. Behind our position was a steep and deep dip, \n",
      "making it difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire. \n",
      "Prince Andrew took out his notebook and, leaning on the \n",
      "cannon, sketched a plan of th e position. He made some \n",
      "notes on two points, intending to mention them to \n",
      "Bagration. His idea was, firs t, to concentrate all the \n",
      "artillery in the center, a nd secondly, to withdraw the \n",
      "cavalry to the other side of the dip. Prince Andrew, being \n",
      "always near the commander in  chief, closely following \n",
      "the mass movements and general orders, and constantly \n",
      "studying historical accounts of  battles, involuntarily \n",
      "pictured to himself the course of events in the \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "401 of 2882 \n",
      "forthcoming action in broad outline. He imagined only \n",
      "important possibilities: ‘If the enemy attacks the right \n",
      "flank,’ he said to himself, ‘the Kiev grenadiers and the \n",
      "Podolsk chasseurs must hold their position till reserves \n",
      "from the center come up. In that case the dragoons could \n",
      "successfully make a flank counterattack. If they attack our \n",
      "center we, having the center battery on this high ground, \n",
      "shall withdraw the left flank under its cover, and retreat to \n",
      "the dip by echelons.’ So he reasoned.... All the time he \n",
      "had been beside the gun, he had heard the voices of the \n",
      "officers distinctly, but as often happens had not \n",
      "understood a word of what th ey were saying. Suddenly, \n",
      "however, he was struck by a voice coming from the shed, \n",
      "and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen. \n",
      "‘No, friend,’ said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince \n",
      "Andrew, a familiar voice, ‘what I say is that if it were \n",
      "possible to know what is be yond death, none of us would \n",
      "be afraid of it. That’s so, friend.’ \n",
      "Another, a younger voice, inte rrupted him: ‘Afraid or \n",
      "not, you can’t escape it anyhow.’ \n",
      "‘All the same, one is afra id! Oh, you clever people,’ \n",
      "said a third manly voice interrupting them both. ‘Of \n",
      "course you artillery men ar e very wise, because you can \n",
      "take everything along with you- vodka and snacks.’ War and Peace  \n",
      "402 of 2882 \n",
      "And the owner of the manl y voice, evidently an \n",
      "infantry officer, laughed. \n",
      "‘Yes, one is afraid,’ continued the firs t speaker, he of \n",
      "the familiar voice. ‘One is afraid of the unknown, that’s \n",
      "what it is. Whatever we may say about the soul going to \n",
      "the sky... we know there is no sky but only an \n",
      "atmosphere.’ \n",
      "The manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer. \n",
      "‘Well, stand us some of your herb vodka, Tushin,’ it \n",
      "said. \n",
      "‘Why,’ thought Prince Andrew, ‘that’s the captain who \n",
      "stood up in the sutler’s hu t without his boots.’ He \n",
      "recognized the agreeable,  philosophizing voice with \n",
      "pleasure. \n",
      "‘Some herb vodka? Certainly!’ said Tushin. ‘But still, \n",
      "to conceive a future life..’ \n",
      "He did not finish. Just then  there was a whistle in the \n",
      "air; nearer and nearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, \n",
      "a cannon ball, as if  it had not finished saying what was \n",
      "necessary, thudded into the gr ound near the shed with \n",
      "super human force, throwing up a mass of earth. The \n",
      "ground seemed to groan at the terrible impact. \n",
      "And immediately Tushin, w ith a short pipe in the \n",
      "corner of his mouth and hi s kind, intelligen t face rather \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "403 of 2882 \n",
      "pale, rushed out of the shed followed by the owner of the \n",
      "manly voice, a dashing infantry  officer who hurried off to \n",
      "his company, buttoning up his coat as he ran. War and Peace  \n",
      "404 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XVII \n",
      "Mounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with \n",
      "the battery, looking at the puff from the gun that had sent \n",
      "the ball. His eyes ran rapidly over the wide space, but he \n",
      "only saw that the hitherto motionless masses of the \n",
      "French now swayed and that there really was a battery to \n",
      "their left. The smoke above it had not yet dispersed. Two \n",
      "mounted Frenchmen, probably adjutants, were galloping \n",
      "up the hill. A small but distin ctly visible enemy column \n",
      "was moving down the hill, probably to strengthen the \n",
      "front line. The smoke of the first shot had not yet \n",
      "dispersed before another puff appeared, followed by a \n",
      "report. The battle had begun! Prince Andrew turned his \n",
      "horse and galloped back to  Grunth to find Prince \n",
      "Bagration. He heard the cannonade behind him growing \n",
      "louder and more frequent. Evidently our guns had begun \n",
      "to reply. From the bottom of the slope, where the parleys \n",
      "had taken place, came the report of musketry. \n",
      "Lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with Bonaparte’s \n",
      "stern letter, and Murat, hum iliated and anxious to expiate \n",
      "his fault, had at once moved his forces to attack the center \n",
      "and outflank both the Russian wings, hoping before \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "405 of 2882 \n",
      "evening and before the arrival of the Emperor to crush the \n",
      "contemptible detachment that stood before him. \n",
      "‘It has begun. Here it is!’  thought Prince Andrew, \n",
      "feeling the blood rush to his heart. ‘But where and how \n",
      "will my Toulon present itself?’ \n",
      "Passing between the companies that had been eating \n",
      "porridge and drinking vodka a qua rter of an hour before, \n",
      "he saw everywhere the same rapid movement of soldiers \n",
      "forming ranks and getting their muskets ready, and on all \n",
      "their faces he recognized th e same eagerness that filled \n",
      "his heart. ‘It has begun! Here it is, dreadful but \n",
      "enjoyable!’ was what the face of each soldier and each \n",
      "officer seemed to say. \n",
      "Before he had reached the embankments that were \n",
      "being thrown up, he saw, in the light of the dull autumn \n",
      "evening, mounted men coming toward him. The foremost, \n",
      "wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a \n",
      "white horse, was Prince Bagration. Prince Andrew \n",
      "stopped, waiting for him to co me up; Prince Bagration \n",
      "reined in his hor se and recognizing Prince Andrew \n",
      "nodded to him. He still looked ahead while Prince \n",
      "Andrew told him what he had seen. \n",
      "The feeling, ‘It has begun! Here it is!’ was seen even \n",
      "on Prince Bagration’s hard brown face with its half-War and Peace  \n",
      "406 of 2882 \n",
      "closed, dull, sleepy eyes. Prince Andrew gazed with \n",
      "anxious curiosity at that impassive face and wished he \n",
      "could tell what, if anythi ng, this man was thinking and \n",
      "feeling at that moment. ‘Is there anything at all behind \n",
      "that impassive face?’ Prince Andrew asked himself as he \n",
      "looked. Prince Bagration bent his head in sign of \n",
      "agreement with what Prince Andrew told him, and said, \n",
      "‘Very good!’ in a tone that  seemed to imply that \n",
      "everything that took place a nd was reported to him was \n",
      "exactly what he had foreseen. Prince Andrew, out of \n",
      "breath with his rapid ride, spoke quickly. Prince \n",
      "Bagration, uttering his words with an Oriental accent, \n",
      "spoke particularly slowly, as if to impress the fact that \n",
      "there was no need to hurry. However, he put his horse to a \n",
      "trot in the direction of Tush in’s battery. Prince Andrew \n",
      "followed with the suite. Behi nd Prince Bagration rode an \n",
      "officer of the suite, the pr ince’s personal adjutant, \n",
      "Zherkov, an orderly officer, the staff officer on duty, \n",
      "riding a fine bobtailed horse, and a civilian- an accountant \n",
      "who had asked permission to be present at the battle out \n",
      "of curiosity. The accountant, a stout, full-faced man, \n",
      "looked around him with a naiv e smile of satisfaction and \n",
      "presented a strange appearance among the hussars, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "407 of 2882 \n",
      "Cossacks, and adjutants, in his camlet coat, as he jolted on \n",
      "his horse with a convoy officer’s saddle. \n",
      "‘He wants to see a battle,’ said Zherkov to Bolkonski, \n",
      "pointing to the accountant, ‘but he feels a pain in the pit \n",
      "of his stomach already.’ \n",
      "‘Oh, leave off!’ said the accountant with a beaming but \n",
      "rather cunning smile, as if flattered at being made the \n",
      "subject of Zherkov’s joke, and purposely trying to appear \n",
      "stupider than he really was. \n",
      "‘It is very strange, mon Monsieur Prince,’ said the staff \n",
      "officer. (He remembered that in French there is some \n",
      "peculiar way of addressing a prince, but could not get it \n",
      "quite right.) \n",
      "By this time they were all approaching Tushin’s \n",
      "battery, and a ball struck the ground in front of them. \n",
      "‘What’s that that has fallen?’ asked the accountant \n",
      "with a naive smile. \n",
      "‘A French pancake,’ answered Zherkov. \n",
      "‘So that’s what they hit w ith?’ asked th e accountant. \n",
      "‘How awful!’ \n",
      "He seemed to swell with satisfaction. He had hardly \n",
      "finished speaking when they again heard an unexpectedly \n",
      "violent whistling which suddenly ended with a thud into \n",
      "something soft... f-f-flop! and a Cossack, riding a little to War and Peace  \n",
      "408 of 2882 \n",
      "their right and behind the accountant, crashed to earth \n",
      "with his horse. Zherkov and the staff officer bent over \n",
      "their saddles and turned  their horses away. The \n",
      "accountant stopped, facing the Cossack, and examined \n",
      "him with attentive curiosity. The Cossack was dead, but \n",
      "the horse still struggled. \n",
      "Prince Bagration screwed up his eyes, looked round, \n",
      "and, seeing the cause of the confusion, turned away with \n",
      "indifference, as if to say, ‘Is it worth while noticing \n",
      "trifles?’ He reined in his horse  with the case of a skillful \n",
      "rider and, slightly bending over, disengaged his saber \n",
      "which had caught in his cloak. It was an old-fashioned \n",
      "saber of a kind no longer in general use. Prince Andrew \n",
      "remembered the story of Suvorov giving his saber to \n",
      "Bagration in Italy, and the r ecollection was particularly \n",
      "pleasant at that moment. They  had reached the battery at \n",
      "which Prince Andrew had been when he examined the \n",
      "battlefield. \n",
      "‘Whose company?’ asked Prince Bagration of an \n",
      "artilleryman standing by the ammunition wagon. \n",
      "He asked, ‘Whose company?’ but he really meant, \n",
      "‘Are you frightened here ?’ and the artilleryman \n",
      "understood him. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "409 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Captain Tushin’s, your excellency!’ shouted the red-\n",
      "haired, freckled gunner in a merry voice, standing to \n",
      "attention. \n",
      "‘Yes, yes,’ muttered Bagra tion as if considering \n",
      "something, and he rode past the limbers to the farthest \n",
      "cannon. \n",
      "As he approached, a ringing shot issued from it \n",
      "deafening him and his suite, and in the smoke that \n",
      "suddenly surrounded the gun th ey could see the gunners \n",
      "who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its \n",
      "former position. A huge, broad-shouldered gunner, \n",
      "Number One, holding a mop, his legs far apart, sprang to \n",
      "the wheel; while Number Two with a trembling hand \n",
      "placed a charge in the cannon’s mouth. The short, round-\n",
      "shouldered Captain Tushin, stum bling over the tail of the \n",
      "gun carriage, moved forwar d and, not noticing the \n",
      "general, looked out shading his eyes with his small hand. \n",
      "‘Lift it two lines more and it will be just right,’ cried he \n",
      "in a feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing \n",
      "note, ill suited to his weak  figure. ‘Number Two!’ he \n",
      "squeaked. ‘Fire, Medvedev!’ \n",
      "Bagration called to him, and Tushin, raising three \n",
      "fingers to his cap with a bashful and awkward gesture not \n",
      "at all like a military salute but like a priest’s benediction, War and Peace  \n",
      "410 of 2882 \n",
      "approached the general. T hough Tushin’s guns had been \n",
      "intended to cannonade the valley, he was firing incendiary \n",
      "balls at the village of Schon Grabern visible just opposite, \n",
      "in front of which large masses of French were advancing. \n",
      "No one had given Tushin orders where and at what to \n",
      "fire, but after consulting his sergeant major, \n",
      "Zakharchenko, for whom he had great respect, he had \n",
      "decided that it would be a good  thing to set fire to the \n",
      "village. ‘Very good!’ said Bagration in reply to the \n",
      "officer’s report, and began deliberately to examine the \n",
      "whole battlefield extended be fore him. The French had \n",
      "advanced nearest on our right. Below the height on which \n",
      "the Kiev regiment was stati oned, in the hollow where the \n",
      "rivulet flowed, the soul-stirring rolling and crackling of \n",
      "musketry was heard, and much farther to the right beyond \n",
      "the dragoons, the officer of the suite pointed out to \n",
      "Bagration a French column that was outflanking us. To \n",
      "the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood. Prince \n",
      "Bagration ordered two battali ons from the center to be \n",
      "sent to reinforce the right fl ank. The officer of the suite \n",
      "ventured to remark to the prince that if these battalions \n",
      "went away, the guns would remain without support. \n",
      "Prince Bagration turned to the officer and with his dull \n",
      "eyes looked at him in silence. It seemed to Prince Andrew \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "411 of 2882 \n",
      "that the officer’s remark was just and that really no \n",
      "answer could be made to it. But at that moment an \n",
      "adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander \n",
      "of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense \n",
      "masses of the French were  coming down upon them and \n",
      "that his regiment was in disorder and was retreating upon \n",
      "the Kiev grenadiers. Prince Ba gration bowed his head in \n",
      "sign of assent and approval. He rode off at a walk to the \n",
      "right and sent an adjutant to  the dragoons with orders to \n",
      "attack the French. But this ad jutant returned half an hour \n",
      "later with the news that th e commander of the dragoons \n",
      "had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground, as a \n",
      "heavy fire had been opene d on him and he was losing \n",
      "men uselessly, and so had hastened to throw some \n",
      "sharpshooters into the wood. \n",
      "‘Very good!’ said Bagration. \n",
      "As he was leaving the batte ry, firing was heard on the \n",
      "left also, and as it was too fa r to the left flank for him to \n",
      "have time to go there himself, Prince Bagration sent \n",
      "Zherkov to tell the general in command (the one who had \n",
      "paraded his regiment before Ku tuzov at Braunau) that he \n",
      "must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in \n",
      "the rear, as the right flank w ould probably not be able to \n",
      "withstand the enemy’s attack very long. About Tushin \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "412 of 2882 \n",
      "and the battalion that had been in support of his battery all \n",
      "was forgotten. Prince Andrew  listened attentively to \n",
      "Bagration’s colloquies with the commanding officers and \n",
      "the orders he gave them and, to his surprise, found that no \n",
      "orders were really given, but that Prince Bagration tried to \n",
      "make it appear that everything done by necessity, by \n",
      "accident, or by the will of subordinate commanders was \n",
      "done, if not by his direct command, at least in accord with \n",
      "his intentions. Prince Andr ew noticed, however, that \n",
      "though what happened was due to chance and was \n",
      "independent of the commander’s will, owing to the tact \n",
      "Bagration showed, his pres ence was very valuable. \n",
      "Officers who approached  him with disturbed \n",
      "countenances became calm; soldiers and officers greeted \n",
      "him gaily, grew more cheerful in his presence, and were \n",
      "evidently anxious to display their courage before him. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "413 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XVIII \n",
      "Prince Bagration, having reached the highest point of \n",
      "our right flank, began riding downhill to where the roll of \n",
      "musketry was heard but where on account of the smoke \n",
      "nothing could be seen. The nearer they got to the hollow \n",
      "the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness \n",
      "of the actual battlefield. They began to meet wounded \n",
      "men. One with a bleeding head and no cap was being \n",
      "dragged along by two soldiers who supported him under \n",
      "the arms. There was a gurgle in his throat and he was \n",
      "spitting blood. A bullet had evidently hit him in the throat \n",
      "or mouth. Another was walki ng sturdily by himself but \n",
      "without his musket, groaning aloud and swinging his arm \n",
      "which had just been hurt, while blood from it was \n",
      "streaming over his greatcoat as  from a bottle. He had that \n",
      "moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather \n",
      "than suffering. Crossing a road they descended a steep \n",
      "incline and saw several men lying on the ground; they \n",
      "also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were \n",
      "unwounded. The soldiers were ascending the hill \n",
      "breathing heavily, and despite the general’s presence were \n",
      "talking loudly and gesticulati ng. In front of them rows of War and Peace  \n",
      "414 of 2882 \n",
      "gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke, and \n",
      "an officer catching sight of Bagration rushed shouting \n",
      "after the crowd of retreating soldiers, ordering them back. \n",
      "Bagration rode up to the ranks along which shots crackled \n",
      "now here and now there, drowning the sound of voices \n",
      "and the shouts of command. The whole air reeked with \n",
      "smoke. The excited faces of th e soldiers were blackened \n",
      "with it. Some were using their ramrods, others putting \n",
      "powder on the touchpans or taking charges from their \n",
      "pouches, while others were firing, though who they were \n",
      "firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was \n",
      "no wind to carry away. A pleasant humming and \n",
      "whistling of bullets were often heard. ‘What is this?’ \n",
      "thought Prince Andrew appr oaching the crowd of \n",
      "soldiers. ‘It can’t be an attack, for they are not moving; it \n",
      "can’t be a square- for they are not drawn up for that.’ \n",
      "The commander of the regiment, a thin, feeble-looking \n",
      "old man with a pleasant smile- his eyelids drooping more \n",
      "than half over his old eyes, giving him a mild expression, \n",
      "rode up to Bagration and welcomed him as a host \n",
      "welcomes an honored guest. He reported that his regiment \n",
      "had been attacked by French cavalry and that, though the \n",
      "attack had been repulsed, he had lost more than half his \n",

      "415 of 2882 \n",
      "military term to describe what had occurred to his \n",
      "regiment, but in reality he did not himself know what had \n",
      "happened during that half-hour to the troops entrusted to \n",
      "him, and could not say with certainty whether the attack \n",
      "had been repulsed or his regiment had been broken up. \n",
      "All he knew was that at the commencement of the action \n",
      "balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and \n",
      "hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted \n",
      "‘Cavalry!’ and our men had begun firing. They were still \n",
      "firing, not at the cavalry wh ich had disappeared, but at \n",
      "French infantry who had come  into the hollow and were \n",
      "firing at our men. Prince Bagr ation bowed his head as a \n",

      "down the two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs whom \n",
      "they had just passed. Prince Andrew was struck by the \n",
      "changed expression on Prin ce Bagration’s face at this \n",
      "moment. It expressed the concentrated and happy \n",
      "resolution you see on the face of a man who on a hot day \n",
      "takes a final run before plunging into the water. The dull, \n",
      "sleepy expression was no longer there, nor the affectation \n",
      "of profound thought. The round, steady, hawk’s eyes \n",
      "looked before him eagerly and rather disdainfully, not War and Peace  \n",
      "416 of 2882 \n",
      "resting on anything although hi s movements were still \n",
      "slow and measured. \n",
      "The commander of the regiment turned to Prince \n",
      "Bagration, entreating him to go back as it was too \n",
      "dangerous to remain where they were. ‘Please, your \n",
      "excellency, for God’s sake!’ he kept saying, glancing for \n",
      "support at an officer of the suite who turned away from \n",
      "him. ‘There, you see!’ and he drew attention to the bullets \n",
      "whistling, singing, and hissing continually around them. \n",
      "He spoke in the tone of en treaty and reproach that a \n",
      "carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax: \n",
      "‘We are used to it, but you, si r, will blister your hands.’ \n",
      "He spoke as if those bullets could not kill him, and his \n",
      "half-closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his \n",
      "words. The staff officer joined in the colonel’s appeals, \n",
      "but Bagration did not reply; he only gave an order to \n",
      "cease firing and re-form, so as  to give room for the two \n",
      "approaching battalions. While he was speaking, the \n",
      "curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow, driven by \n",
      "a rising wind, began to move from right to left as if drawn \n",
      "by an invisible hand, and the hill opposite, with the \n",
      "French moving about on it, opened out before them. All \n",
      "eyes fastened involuntarily on this French column \n",
      "advancing against them and winding down over the \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "417 of 2882 \n",
      "uneven ground. One could already see the soldiers’ \n",
      "shaggy caps, distinguish the officers from the men, and \n",
      "see the standard flapping against its staff. \n",
      "‘They march splendidly,’ remarked someone in \n",

      "The head of the column had already descended into the \n",
      "hollow. The clash would take place on this side of it... \n",
      "The remains of our regiment which had been in action \n",
      "rapidly formed up and moved to  the right; from behind it, \n",
      "dispersing the laggards, came two battalions of the Sixth \n",
      "Chasseurs in fine order. Before they had reached \n",
      "Bagration, the weighty tread of the mass of men marching \n",
      "in step could be heard. On their left flank, nearest to \n",
      "Bagration, marched a company commander, a fine round-\n",
      "faced man, with a stupid and happy expression- the same \n",
      "man who had rushed out of the wattle shed. At that \n",
      "moment he was clearly th inking of nothing but how \n",
      "dashing a fellow he would appear as he passed the \n",
      "commander. \n",
      "With the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he \n",
      "stepped lightly with his muscul ar legs as if sailing along, \n",
      "stretching himself to his full height without the smallest \n",
      "effort, his ease contrasting with the heavy tread of the \n",
      "soldiers who were keeping step with him. He carried close War and Peace  \n",
      "418 of 2882 \n",
      "to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword (small, curved, and \n",
      "not like a real weapon) and looked now at the superior \n",
      "officers and now back at the men without losing step, his \n",
      "whole powerful body turning flexibly. It was as if all the \n",
      "powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the \n",
      "commander in the best possibl e manner, and feeling that \n",
      "he was doing it well he was ha ppy. ‘Left... left... left...’ he \n",
      "seemed to repeat to himself at  each alternate step; and in \n",
      "time to this, with stern but varied faces, the wall of \n",
      "soldiers burdened with kna psacks and muskets marched \n",
      "in step, and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed \n",
      "to be repeating to himself at  each alternate step, ‘Left... \n",
      "left... left...’ A fat major skirted a bush, puffing and \n",
      "falling out of step; a soldie r who had fallen behind, his \n",
      "face showing alarm at his defec tion, ran at a trot, panting \n",
      "to catch up with his company. A cannon ball, cleaving the \n",
      "air, flew over the heads of Bagration and his suite, and \n",
      "fell into the column to the m easure of ‘Left... left!’ ‘Close \n",
      "up!’ came the company commander’s voice in jaunty \n",
      "tones. The soldiers passe d in a semicircle round \n",
      "something where the ball had fallen, and an old trooper on \n",
      "the flank, a noncommissioned officer who had stopped \n",
      "beside the dead men, ran to catch up his line and, falling \n",
      "into step with a hop, looked back angrily, and through the \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "419 of 2882 \n",
      "ominous silence and the regular  tramp of feet beating the \n",
      "ground in unison, one seemed to hear left... left... left. \n",
      "‘Well done, lads!’ said Prince Bagration. \n",
      "‘Glad to do our best, your  ex’len-lency!’ came a \n",
      "confused shout from the ranks. A morose soldier \n",
      "marching on the left turned his eyes on Bagration as he \n",
      "shouted, with an expression that seemed to say: ‘We \n",
      "know that ourselves!’ Another, without looking round, as \n",
      "though fearing to relax, shouted with his mouth wide open \n",
      "and passed on. \n",
      "The order was given to halt and down knapsacks. \n",
      "Bagration rode round the ranks  that had marched past \n",
      "him and dismounted. He gave the reins to a Cossack, took \n",
      "off and handed over his felt co at, stretched his legs, and \n",
      "set his cap straight. The head of the French column, with \n",
      "its officers leading, appeared from below the hill. \n",
      "‘Forward, with God!’ said Bagration, in a resolute, \n",
      "sonorous voice, turning for a moment to the front line, \n",
      "and slightly swinging his arms , he went forward uneasily \n",
      "over the rough field with the awkward gait of a \n",
      "cavalryman. Prince Andrew fe lt that an invisible power \n",

      "420 of 2882 \n",
      "The French were already near. Prince Andrew, walking \n",
      "beside Bagration, could cl early distinguish their \n",

      "distinctly saw an old French  officer who, with gaitered \n",
      "legs and turned-out toes, clim bed the hill with difficulty.) \n",
      "Prince Bagration gave no furt her orders and silently \n",
      "continued to walk on in front  of the ranks. Suddenly one \n",
      "shot after another rang out from the French, smoke \n",
      "appeared all along their uneven ranks, and musket shots \n",
      "sounded. Several of our men fell, among them the round-\n",
      "faced officer who had marched so gaily and \n",
      "complacently. But at the moment the first report was \n",
      "heard, Bagration looked round and shouted, ‘Hurrah!’ \n",
      "‘Hurrah- ah!- ah!’ rang a long-drawn shout from our \n",
      "ranks, and passing Bagration and racing one another they \n",

      "The attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of \n",
      "our right flank. In the center Tushin’s forgotten battery, \n",
      "which had managed to set fire to the Schon Grabern \n",
      "village, delayed the French advance. The French were \n",
      "putting out the fire which the wind was spreading, and \n",
      "thus gave us time to retreat. The retirement of the center \n",
      "to the other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was \n",
      "hurried and noisy, but the diffe rent companies did not get \n",
      "mixed. But our left- which consisted of the Azov and \n",
      "Podolsk infantry and the Pavlograd hussars- was \n",
      "simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior \n",

      "Having reached the left flank, instead of going to the \n",

      "422 of 2882 \n",
      "general and his staff where they could not possibly be, \n",
      "and so did not deliver the order. \n",

      "engaged in discussion with th e sole object of offending \n",
      "one another. But the regiment s, both cavalry and infantry, \n",
      "were by no means ready for the impending action. From \n",
      "privates to general they were  not expecting a battle and \n",
      "were engaged in peaceful occupations, the cavalry feeding \n",
      "the horses and the infantry collecting wood. \n",
      "‘He higher iss dan I in rank,’ said the German colonel \n",
      "of the hussars, flushing and addressing an adjutant who \n",
      "had ridden up, ‘so let him do wh at he vill, but I cannot \n",
      "sacrifice my hussars... Bugler, sount ze retreat!’ \n",
      "But haste was becoming imperative. Cannon and \n",
      "musketry, mingling together, thundered on the right and \n",
      "in the center, while the capot es of Lannes’ sharpshooters \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "423 of 2882 \n",
      "were already seen crossing the milldam and forming up \n",
      "within twice the range of a musket shot. The general in \n",
      "command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky \n",
      "steps, and having mounted drew himself up very straight \n",
      "and tall and rode to the Pavlograd commander. The \n",
      "commanders met with polite bows but with secret \n",
      "malevolence in their hearts. \n",
      "‘Once again, Colonel,’ said the general, ‘I can’t leave \n",
      "half my men in the wood. I beg of you, I beg of you,’ he \n",
      "repeated, ‘to occupy the position and prepare for an \n",
      "attack.’ \n",
      "‘I peg of you yourself not to  mix in vot is not your \n",

      "424 of 2882 \n",
      "Taking the colonel’s outburst  as a challenge to his \n",
      "courage, the general expanded his chest and rode, \n",
      "frowning, beside him to the front line, as if their \n",
      "differences would be settle d there amongst the bullets. \n",
      "They reached the front, seve ral bullets sped over them, \n",
      "and they halted in silence. There was nothing fresh to be \n",
      "seen from the line, for from where they had been before it \n",
      "had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act \n",
      "among the bushes and broken ground, as well as that the \n",
      "French were outflanking our left. The general and colonel \n",
      "looked sternly and significantly  at one another like two \n",
      "fighting cocks preparing for ba ttle, each vainly trying to \n",
      "detect signs of cowardice in the other. Both passed the \n",
      "examination successfully. As there was nothing to said, \n",
      "and neither wished to give occasion for it to be alleged \n",
      "that he had been the first to leave the range of fire, they \n",
      "would have remained there for a long time testing each \n",
      "other’s courage had it not been that just then they heard \n",
      "the rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind \n",
      "them in the wood. The French had attacked the men \n",
      "collecting wood in the copse. It was no longer possible for \n",
      "the hussars to retreat with the infantry. They were cut off \n",
      "from the line of retreat on the left by the French. However \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "425 of 2882 \n",
      "inconvenient the position, it was now necessary to attack \n",
      "in order to cut away through for themselves. \n",
      "The squadron in which Rostov was serving had \n",
      "scarcely time to mount be fore it was halted facing the \n",
      "enemy. Again, as at the Enns bridge, there was nothing \n",
      "between the squadron and the enemy, and again that \n",
      "terrible dividing line of un certainty and fear- resembling \n",
      "the line separating the living from the dead- lay between \n",
      "them. All were conscious of  this unseen line, and the \n",
      "question whether they would th ey would cross it or not, \n",
      "and how they would cross it, agitated them all. \n",
      "The colonel rode to the front , angrily gave some reply \n",
      "to questions put to him by the officers, and, like a man \n",
      "desperately insisting on ha ving his own way, gave an \n",
      "order. No one said anything de finite, but the rumor of an \n",
      "attack spread through the squadron. The command to \n",
      "form up rang out and the sabers whizzed as they were \n",
      "drawn from their scabbards. Still no one moved. The \n",
      "troops of the left flank, infantry and hussars alike, felt that \n",
      "the commander did not himself know what to do, and this \n",
      "irresolution communicated itself to the men. \n",
      "‘If only they would be quick!’ thought Rostov, feeling \n",
      "that at last the time had come  to experience the joy of an War and Peace  \n",
      "426 of 2882 \n",
      "attack of which he had so often heard from his fellow \n",
      "hussars. \n",
      "‘Fo’ward, with God, lads!’ rang out Denisov’s voice. \n",
      "‘At a twot fo’ward!’ \n",
      "The horses’ croups began to sway in the front line. \n",
      "Rook pulled at the reins and started of his own accord. \n",
      "Before him, on the right, Ro stov saw the front lines of \n",
      "his hussars and still farther ahead a dark line which he \n",
      "could not see distinctly but took to be the enemy. Shots \n",
      "could be heard, but some way off. \n",
      "‘Faster!’ came the word of command, and Rostov felt \n",
      "Rook’s flanks drooping as he broke into a gallop. \n",
      "Rostov anticipated his horse’s movements and became \n",
      "more and more elated. He had noticed a solitary tree \n",
      "ahead of him. This tree had been in the middle of the line \n",
      "that had seemed so terrible- and now he had crossed that \n",
      "line and not only was there nothing terrible, but \n",
      "everything was becoming more and more happy and \n",
      "animated. ‘Oh, how I will slash at him!’ thought Rostov, \n",
      "gripping the hilt of his saber. \n",
      "‘Hur-a-a-a-ah!’ came a roar  of voices. ‘Let anyone \n",
      "come my way now,’ thought Rostov driving his spurs into \n",
      "Rook and letting him go at a full gallop so that he \n",
      "outstripped the others. Ahea d, the enemy was already \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "427 of 2882 \n",
      "visible. Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to \n",
      "sweep over the squadron. Rostov raised his saber, ready \n",
      "to strike, but at that inst ant the troope r Nikitenko, who \n",
      "was galloping ahead, shot away from him, and Rostov felt \n",
      "as in a dream that he continue d to be carried forward with \n",
      "unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot. From \n",
      "behind him Bondarchuk, an hussar he knew, jolted against \n",
      "him and looked angrily at  him. Bondarchuk’s horse \n",
      "swerved and galloped past. \n",
      "‘How is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!’ \n",
      "Rostov asked and answered at the same instant. He was \n",
      "alone in the middle of a fi eld. Instead of the moving \n",
      "horses and hussars’ backs, he saw nothing before him but \n",
      "the motionless earth and the stubble around him. There \n",
      "was warm blood under his arm. ‘No, I am wounded and \n",
      "the horse is killed.’ Rook tried to rise on his forelegs but \n",
      "fell back, pinning his rider’s leg. Blood was flowing from \n",
      "his head; he struggled but could not rise. Rostov also tried \n",
      "to rise but fell back, his sabretache having become \n",
      "entangled in the saddle. Wh ere our men were, and where \n",
      "the French, he did not know. There was no one near. \n",
      "Having disentangled his leg, he rose. ‘Where, on which \n",
      "side, was now the line that had so sharply divided the two \n",
      "armies?’ he asked himself and could not answer. ‘Can War and Peace  \n",
      "428 of 2882 \n",
      "something bad have happened to me?’ he wondered as he \n",
      "got up: and at that moment he felt that something \n",
      "superfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm. The \n",
      "wrist felt as if it were not his. He examined his hand \n",
      "carefully, vainly trying to find blood on it. ‘Ah, here are \n",
      "people coming,’ he thought j oyfully, seeing some men \n",
      "running toward him. ‘They will help me!’ In front came a \n",
      "man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak, swarthy, \n",
      "sunburned, and with a hooked nose. Then came two more, \n",
      "and many more running behind. One of them said \n",
      "something strange, not in Russian. In among the hindmost \n",
      "of these men wearing similar shakos was a Russian \n",
      "hussar. He was being held by the arms and his horse was \n",
      "being led behind him. \n",
      "‘It must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes. Can it be that \n",
      "they will take me too? Who are these men?’ thought \n",
      "Rostov, scarcely believing his eyes. ‘Can they be \n",
      "French?’ He looked at the approaching Frenchmen, and \n",
      "though but a moment before he had been galloping to get \n",
      "at them and hack them to pieces, their proximity now \n",
      "seemed so awful that he could not believe his eyes. ‘Who \n",
      "are they? Why are they runni ng? Can they be coming at \n",
      "me? And why? To kill me? Me whom everyone is so fond \n",
      "of?’ He remembered his mother’s love for him, and his \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "429 of 2882 \n",
      "family’s, and his friends’, and the enemy’s intention to \n",
      "kill him seemed impossible. ‘But perhaps they may do it!’ \n",
      "For more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the \n",
      "spot or realizing the situa tion. The foremost Frenchman, \n",
      "the one with the hooked nose, was already so close that \n",
      "the expression of his face could be seen. And the excited, \n",
      "alien face of that man, his bayonet hanging down, holding \n",
      "his breath, and running so lightly, frightened Rostov. He \n",
      "seized his pistol and, instead of firing it, flung it at the \n",
      "Frenchman and ran with all his might toward the bushes. \n",
      "He did not now run with the feeling of doubt and conflict \n",

      "strange, unfamiliar voice called above his head: ‘Captain \n",
      "Tushin! Captain!’ \n",
      "Tushin turned round in dismay. It was the staff officer \n",
      "who had turned him out of the booth at Grunth. He was \n",
      "shouting in a gasping voice: \n",

      "‘Are you mad? You have twice been ordered to retreat, \n",
      "and you..’ \n",

      "in alarm at his superior. \n",

      "cap. ‘I..’ \n",
      "But the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to \n",
      "say. A cannon ball, flying clos e to him, caused him to \n",
      "duck and bend over his horse. He paused, and just as he \n",
      "was about to say something more, another ball stopped \n",
      "him. He turned his horse and galloped off. \n",
      "‘Retire! All to retire!’ he shouted from a distance. \n",
      "The soldiers laughed. A moment later, an adjutant \n",
      "arrived with the same order. \n",
      "It was Prince Andrew. The fi rst thing he saw on riding \n",
      "up to the space where Tushin’s guns were stationed was \n",
      "an unharnessed horse with a broken leg, that lay \n",
      "screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses. Blood \n",
      "was gushing from its leg as from a spring. Among the \n",
      "limbers lay several dead men. One ball after another \n",
      "passed over as he approached and he felt a nervous \n",
      "shudder run down his spine. But the mere thought of \n",
      "being afraid roused him again. ‘I cannot be afraid,’ \n",
      "thought he, and dismounted slowly among the guns. He War and Peace  \n",
      "440 of 2882 \n",
      "delivered the order and did not leave the battery. He \n",
      "decided to have the guns re moved from their positions \n",
      "and withdrawn in his presence. Together with Tushin, \n",
      "stepping across the bodies and under a terrible fire from \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "445 of 2882 \n",

      "From all sides were heard th e footsteps and talk of the \n",

      "the horses’ hoofs moving in mud, the crack ling of wood \n",
      "fires near and afar, merged into one tremulous rumble. \n",
      "It was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen river \n",
      "flowing through the gloom, but a dark sea swelling and \n",
      "gradually subsiding after a st orm. Rostov looked at and \n",
      "listened listlessly to what pa ssed before and around him. \n",
      "An infantryman came to the fire, squatted on his heels, \n",
      "held his hands to the blaze, and turned away his face. War and Peace  \n",
      "446 of 2882 \n",
      "‘You don’t mind your honor?’ he asked Tushin. ‘I’ve \n",

      "With the soldier, an infantry officer with a bandaged \n",
      "cheek came up to the bonfire, and addressing Tushin \n",
      "asked him to have the guns moved a trifle to let a wagon \n",
      "go past. After he had gone, two soldiers rushed to the \n",
      "campfire. They were quarreli ng and fighting desperately, \n",
      "each trying to snatch from the other a boot they were both \n",
      "holding on to. \n",
      "‘You picked it up?... I dare say! You’re very smart!’ \n",

      "‘Must one die like a dog?’ said he. \n",

      "‘A nice little hot torch for the infantry! Good luck to \n",

      "general who had served blamelessly for twenty-two years, \n",
      "flushed by a glass of vodka and the dinner; and the staff \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "448 of 2882 \n",

      "In a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from \n",

      "because the banner really interested him, perhaps because \n",
      "it was hard for him, hungry as he was, to look on at a \n",
      "dinner where there was no place for him. In the next hut \n",
      "there was a French colonel who had been taken prisoner \n",
      "by our dragoons. Our officers were flocking in to look at \n",
      "him. Prince Bagration was thanking the individual \n",
      "commanders and inquiring into  details of the action and \n",
      "our losses. The general whose regiment had been \n",

      "449 of 2882 \n",
      "The general had so wished to do this and was so sorry \n",
      "he had not managed to do it that  it seemed to him as if it \n",

      "so? Could one possibly make out  amid all that confusion \n",
      "what did or did not happen? \n",
      "‘By the way, your excellency, I should inform you,’ he \n",
      "continued- remembering Dolokhov’s conversation with \n",

      "Several of those present smiled at Zherkov’s words, \n",
      "expecting one of his usual jokes, but noticing that what he \n",
      "was saying redounded to the glory of our arms and of the \n",
      "day’s work, they assumed a serious expression, though \n",
      "many of them knew that what  he was saying was a lie \n",
      "devoid of any foundation. Prince Bagration turned to the \n",
      "old colonel: War and Peace  \n",
      "450 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Gentlemen, I thank you all; all arms have behaved \n",
      "heroically: infantry, cavalry, and artillery. How was it that \n",
      "two guns were abandoned in the center?’ he inquired, \n",
      "searching with his eyes fo r someone. (Prince Bagration \n",
      "did not ask about the guns on the left flank; he knew that \n",
      "all the guns there had been abandoned at the very \n",
      "beginning of the action.) ‘I th ink I sent you?’ he added, \n",
      "turning to the staff officer on duty. \n",
      "‘One was damaged,’ answered  the staff officer, ‘and \n",
      "the other I can’t understand. I was there all the time \n",

      "hot there,’ he added, modestly. \n",
      "Someone mentioned that Captain Tushin was \n",
      "bivouacking close to the village and had already been sent \n",
      "for. \n",
      "‘Oh, but you were there?’ said Prince Bagration, \n",
      "addressing Prince Andrew. \n",
      "‘Of course, we only just mi ssed one another,’ said the \n",

      "‘I had not the pleasure of seeing you,’ said Prince \n",
      "Andrew, coldly and abruptly. \n",
      "All were silent. Tushin app eared at the threshold and \n",
      "made his way timidly from behind the backs of the \n",
      "generals. As he stepped past the generals in the crowded \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "451 of 2882 \n",
      "hut, feeling embarrassed as he always was by the sight of \n",
      "his superiors, he did not notice the staff of the banner and \n",
      "stumbled over it. Several of those present laughed. \n",
      "‘How was it a gun was abandoned?’ asked Bagration, \n",
      "frowning, not so much at the captain as at those who were \n",
      "laughing, among whom Zherkov laughed loudest. \n",
      "Only now, when he was confronted by the stern \n",
      "authorities, did his guilt and the disgrace of having lost \n",
      "two guns and yet remaining alive present themselves to \n",
      "Tushin in all their horror. He had been so excited that he \n",
      "had not thought about it until that moment. The officers’ \n",
      "laughter confused him still more. He stood before \n",
      "Bagration with his lower jaw trembling and was hardly \n",
      "able to mutter: ‘I don’t know... your excellency... I had no \n",
      "men... your excellency.’ \n",
      "‘You might have taken some from the covering \n",

      "Tushin did not say that there were no covering troops, \n",
      "though that was perfectly true . He was afraid of getting \n",
      "some other officer into trouble,  and silently fixed his eyes \n",
      "on Bagration as a schoolboy who has blundered looks at \n",
      "an examiner. \n",
      "The silence lasted some time. Prince Bagration, \n",
      "apparently not wishing to be severe, found nothing to say; War and Peace  \n",
      "452 of 2882 \n",
      "the others did not venture to intervene. Prince Andrew \n",
      "looked at Tushin from under his brows and his fingers \n",
      "twitched nervously. \n",
      "‘Your excellency!’ Prince Andrew broke the silence \n",
      "with his abrupt voice,’ you we re pleased to send me to \n",
      "Captain Tushin’s battery. I went there and found two \n",
      "thirds of the men and hor ses knocked out, two guns \n",
      "smashed, and no supports at all.’ \n",
      "Prince Bagration and Tu shin looked with equal \n",

      "‘And, if your excellency will allow me to express my \n",

      "to the action of that battery  and the heroic endurance of \n",

      "Prince Bagration looked at Tu shin, evidently reluctant \n",
      "to show distrust in Bolkonski’s emphatic opinion yet not \n",
      "feeling able fully to credit it, bent his head, and told \n",
      "Tushin that he could go. Prince Andrew went out with \n",

      "453 of 2882 \n",
      "Prince Andrew gave him a look, but said nothing and \n",
      "went away. He felt sad and depressed. It was all so \n",
      "strange, so unlike what he had hoped. \n",
      "‘Who are they? Why are th ey here? What do they \n",
      "want? And when will all this end?’ thought Rostov, \n",
      "looking at the changing shadows before him. The pain in \n",
      "his arm became more and more intense. Irresistible \n",
      "drowsiness overpowered him, re d rings danced before his \n",
      "eyes, and the impression of those voices and faces and a \n",
      "sense of loneliness merged w ith the physical pain. It was \n",
      "they, these soldiers- wounded and unwounded- it was \n",
      "they who were crushing, weighing down, and twisting the \n",
      "sinews and scorching the fles h of his sprained arm and \n",
      "shoulder. To rid himself of them he closed his eyes. \n",
      "For a moment he dozed, but in that short interval \n",
      "innumerable things appeared to him in a dream: his \n",
      "mother and her large white hand, Sonya’s thin little \n",
      "shoulders, Natasha’s eyes and laughter, Denisov with his \n",
      "voice and mustache, and Telyanin  and all that affair with \n",
      "Telyanin and Bogdanich. That affair was the same thing \n",
      "as this soldier with the harsh voice, and it was that affair \n",
      "and this soldier that were so agonizingl y, incessantly \n",
      "pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one \n",

      "not for an instant let his shoulder move a hair’s breadth. It \n",
      "would not ache- it would be well- if only they did not pull \n",
      "it, but it was immpossible to get rid of them. \n",
      "He opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy \n",
      "of night hung less than a yard above the glow of the \n",
      "charcoal. Flakes of falling snow were fluttering in that \n",
      "light. Tushin had not return ed, the doctor had not come. \n",
      "He was alone now, except for a soldier who was sitting \n",
      "naked at the other side of the fire, warming his thin \n",

      "who often made him feel conf used by her smiles and her \n",
      "own confusion when meeting him. \n",
      "It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like \n",
      "him, and it would have seemed so unnatural had anyone \n",
      "disliked him, that he could not  but believe in the sincerity \n",
      "of those around him. Besides, he had no time to ask \n",
      "himself whether these people were sincere or not. He was \n",
      "always busy and always felt in a state of mild and \n",
      "cheerful intoxication. He felt as though he were the center \n",
      "of some important and general movement; that something \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "461 of 2882 \n",
      "was constantly expected of him, that if he did not do it he \n",

      "this and that, all would be well; and he did what was \n",
      "demanded of him, but still that happy result always \n",
      "remained in the future. \n",
      "More than anyone else, Pr ince Vasili took possession \n",
      "of Pierre’s affairs and of Pi erre himself in those early \n",
      "days. From the death of Count Bezukhov he did not let go \n",
      "his hold of the lad. He had the air of a man oppressed by \n",
      "business, weary and suffering, who yet would not, for \n",
      "pity’s sake, leave this help less youth who, after all, was \n",
      "the son of his old friend and the possessor of such \n",
      "enormous wealth, to the caprice of fate and the designs of \n",
      "rogues. During the few days he spent in Moscow after the \n",
      "death of Count Bezukhov, he would call Pierre, or go to \n",
      "him himself, and tell him what  ought to be done in a tone \n",
      "of weariness and assurance, as if he were adding every \n",
      "time: ‘You know I am overwhelmed with business and it \n",
      "is purely out of ch arity that I trouble myself about you, \n",
      "and you also know quite well th at what I propose is the \n",
      "only thing possible.’ \n",
      "‘Well, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last,’ \n",
      "said Prince Vasili one day, closing his eyes and fingering \n",
      "Pierre’s elbow, speaking as if he were saying something War and Peace  \n",
      "462 of 2882 \n",
      "which had long since been agreed upon and could not \n",
      "now be altered. ‘We start tomorrow and I’m giving you a \n",
      "place in my carriage. I am ve ry glad. All our important \n",
      "business here is now settled, and I ought to have been off \n",
      "long ago. Here is something I have received from the \n",
      "chancellor. I asked him for you, and you have been \n",
      "entered in the diplomatic co rps and made a Gentleman of \n",
      "the Bedchamber. The diplomatic career now lies open \n",
      "before you.’ \n",
      "Notwithstanding the tone of  wearied assurance with \n",
      "which these words were pronounced, Pierre, who had so \n",
      "long been considering his car eer, wished to make some \n",
      "suggestion. But Prince Vasili interrupted him in the \n",
      "special deep cooing tone, precluding the possibility of \n",
      "interrupting his speech, which he used in extreme cases \n",
      "when special persuasion was needed. \n",
      "‘Mais, mon cher, I did this for my own sake, to satisfy \n",
      "my conscience, and there is nothing to thank me for. No \n",
      "one has ever complained yet of being too much loved; and \n",
      "besides, you are free, you could throw it up tomorrow. \n",
      "But you will see everything for yourself when you get to \n",
      "Petersburg. It is high time for you to get away from these \n",
      "terrible recollections.’ Prince Vasili sighed. ‘Yes, yes, my \n",
      "boy. And my valet can go in your carriage. Ah! I was \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "463 of 2882 \n",
      "nearly forgetting,’ he added. ‘You know, mon cher, your \n",
      "father and I had some account s to settle, so I have \n",
      "received what was due from the Ryazan estate and will \n",
      "keep it; you won’t require it. We’ll go into the accounts \n",
      "later.’ \n",
      "By ‘what was due from the Ryazan estate’ Prince \n",
      "Vasili meant several thousand rubles quitrent received \n",
      "from Pierre’s peasants, which the prince had retained for \n",
      "himself. \n",
      "In Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same \n",
      "atmosphere of gentleness and affection. He could not \n",
      "refuse the post, or rather the rank (for he did nothing), that \n",
      "Prince Vasili had procured for him, and acquaintances, \n",
      "invitations, and social occupations were so numerous that, \n",
      "even more than in Mosc ow, he felt a sense of \n",
      "bewilderment, bustle, and cont inual expectation of some \n",
      "good, always in front of him but never attained. \n",
      "Of his former bachelor ac quaintances many were no \n",
      "longer in Petersburg. The Gu ards had gone to the front; \n",
      "Dolokhov had been reduced to the ranks; Anatole was in \n",
      "the army somewhere in the provinces; Prince Andrew was \n",
      "abroad; so Pierre had not th e opportunity to spend his \n",

      "mind by intimate talks with a friend older than himself War and Peace  \n",
      "464 of 2882 \n",
      "and whom he respected. His whole time was taken up \n",
      "with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at Prince \n",
      "Vasili’s house in the compa ny of the stout princess, his \n",
      "wife, and his beautiful daughter Helene. \n",
      "Like the others, Anna Pavl ovna Scherer showed Pierre \n",
      "the change of attitude toward  him that had taken place in \n",
      "society. \n",
      "Formerly in Anna Pavlovna’s presence, Pierre had \n",
      "always felt that what he wa s saying was out of place, \n",
      "tactless and unsuitable, that remarks which seemed to him \n",
      "clever while they formed in his mind became foolish as \n",
      "soon as he uttered them, while on the contrary \n",
      "Hippolyte’s stupidest remarks came out clever and apt. \n",
      "Now everything Pierre said wa s charmant. Even if Anna \n",
      "Pavlovna did not say so, he c ould see that she wished to \n",
      "and only refrained out of regard for his modesty. \n",
      "In the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 Pierre \n",
      "received one of Anna Pavlovna’s usual pink notes with an \n",
      "invitation to which was added: ‘You will find the \n",
      "beautiful Helene here, whom it is always delightful to \n",
      "see.’ \n",
      "When he read that sentence, Pierre felt for the first \n",

      "both alarmed him, as if so me obligation were being \n",
      "imposed on him which he could not fulfill, and pleased \n",
      "him as an entertaining supposition. \n",
      "Anna Pavlovna’s ‘At Home’ was like the former one, \n",

      "she showed at the mention of her most august Majesty the \n",
      "Empress Marya Fedorovna. Pier re felt flattered by this. \n",
      "Anna Pavlovna arranged th e different groups in her \n",
      "drawing room with her habitual skill. The large group, in \n",
      "which were Prince Vasili and the generals, had the benefit \n",
      "of the diplomat. Another group was at the tea table. Pierre \n",
      "wished to join the former , but Anna Pavlovna- who was \n",
      "in the excited condition of a commander on a battlefield War and Peace  \n",
      "466 of 2882 \n",
      "to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which \n",
      "there is hardly time to put in action- seeing Pierre, \n",
      "touched his sleeve with her finger, saying: \n",
      "‘Wait a bit, I have something in view for you this \n",
      "evening.’ (She glanced at Helene and smiled at her.) ‘My \n",
      "dear Helene, be charitable to  my poor aunt who adores \n",
      "you. Go and keep her company for ten minutes. And that \n",

      "refuse to accompany you.’ \n",
      "The beauty went to the aunt, but Anna Pavlovna \n",
      "detained Pierre, looking as if she had to give some final \n",
      "necessary instructions. \n",
      "‘Isn’t she exquisite?’ she said to Pierre, pointing to the \n",
      "stately beauty as she glided away. ‘And how she carries \n",
      "herself! For so young a girl, such tact, such masterly \n",
      "perfection of manner! It come s from her heart. Happy the \n",
      "man who wins her! With her the least worldly of men \n",

      "you think so? I only wanted to know your opinion,’ and \n",
      "Anna Pavlovna let Pierre go. \n",
      "Pierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as to \n",
      "Helene’s perfection of manner.  If he ever thought of \n",

      "The old aunt received the two young people in her \n",
      "corner, but seemed desirous of hiding her adoration for \n",
      "Helene and inclined rather to show her fear of Anna \n",
      "Pavlovna. She looked at her niece, as if inquiring what \n",
      "she was to do with these peopl e. On leaving them, Anna \n",
      "Pavlovna again touched Pierre’s sleeve, saying: ‘I hope \n",
      "you won’t say that it is dull in my house again,’ and she \n",
      "glanced at Helene. \n",
      "Helene smiled, with a look implying that she did not \n",
      "admit the possibility of anyone seeing her without being \n",
      "enchanted. The aunt coughed, swallowed, and said in \n",
      "French that she was very pleased to see Helene, then she \n",
      "turned to Pierre with the same words of welcome and the \n",
      "same look. In the middle of a dull and halting \n",
      "conversation, Helene turned to  Pierre with the beautiful \n",
      "bright smile that she gave to everyone. Pierre was so used \n",
      "to that smile, and it had so little meaning for him, that he \n",
      "paid no attention to it. The aunt was just speaking of a \n",
      "collection of snuffboxes that  had belonged to Pierre’s \n",
      "father, Count Bezukhov, and showed them her own box. \n",
      "Princess Helene asked to see the portrait of the aunt’s \n",

      "‘That is probably the work of Vinesse,’ said Pierre, \n",

      "was being said at the other table. \n",

      "him the snuffbox, passing it acro ss Helene’s back. Helene \n",
      "stooped forward to make room, and looked round with a \n",
      "smile. She was, as always at evening parties, wearing a \n",
      "dress such as was then fashi onable, cut very low at front \n",
      "and back. Her bust, which had always seemed like marble \n",
      "to Pierre, was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes \n",
      "could not but perceive the li ving charm of her neck and \n",
      "shoulders, so near to his lips that he need only have bent \n",
      "his head a little to have touched them. He was conscious \n",
      "of the warmth of her body, th e scent of perfume, and the \n",
      "creaking of her corset as sh e moved. He did not see her \n",
      "marble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress, \n",
      "but all the charm of her body only covered by her \n",
      "garments. And having once seen  this he could not help \n",
      "being aware it, just as we cannot renew an illusion we \n",
      "have once seen through. \n",
      "‘So you have never noticed before how beautiful I \n",
      "am?’ Helene seemed to say. ‘You had not noticed that I \n",
      "am a woman? Yes, I am a woman who may belong to \n",
      "anyone- to you too,’ said her glance. And at that moment \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "469 of 2882 \n",
      "Pierre felt that Helene not only could, but must, be his \n",
      "wife, and that it could not be otherwise. \n",
      "He knew this at that moment as surely as if he had \n",
      "been standing at the altar with her. How and when this \n",
      "would be he did not know, he  did not even know if it \n",
      "would be a good thing (he even felt, he knew not why, \n",
      "that it would be a bad thing), but he knew it would \n",
      "happen. \n",
      "Pierre dropped his eyes, lif ted them again, and wished \n",
      "once more to see her as a distant beauty far removed from \n",
      "him, as he had seen her ever y day until then, but he could \n",
      "no longer do it. He could not, any more than a man who \n",
      "has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the mist \n",
      "and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he \n",
      "has once recognized it to be a tuft of grass. She was \n",
      "terribly close to him. She already had power over him, \n",
      "and between them there was no longer any barrier except \n",
      "the barrier of his own will. \n",
      "‘Well, I will leave you in your little corner,’ came \n",
      "Anna Pavlovna’s voice, ‘I see you are all right there.’ \n",
      "And Pierre, anxiously trying to remember whether he \n",
      "had done anything reprehensi ble, looked round with a \n",
      "blush. It seemed to him that everyone knew what had \n",
      "happened to him as he knew it himself. War and Peace  \n",
      "470 of 2882 \n",
      "A little later when he went up to the large circle, Anna \n",
      "Pavlovna said to him: ‘I hear you are refitting your \n",
      "Petersburg house?’ \n",
      "This was true. The architect had told him that it was \n",
      "necessary, and Pierre, without knowing why, was having \n",
      "his enormous Petersburg house done up. \n",
      "‘That’s a good thing, but don’t move from Prince \n",
      "Vasili’s. It is good to have a friend like the prince,’ she \n",

      "She paused, as women always do, expecting something \n",
      "after they have mentioned th eir age. ‘If you marry it will \n",
      "be a different thing,’ she c ontinued, uniting them both in \n",
      "one glance. Pierre did not look at Helene nor she at him. \n",
      "But she was just as terribly close to him. He muttered \n",
      "something and colored. \n",
      "When he got home he could not sleep for a long time \n",
      "for thinking of what had ha ppened. What had happened? \n",
      "Nothing. He had merely unders tood that the woman he \n",
      "had known as a child, of whom when her beauty was \n",
      "mentioned he had said absent-mindedly: ‘Yes, she’s good \n",

      "belong to him. \n",
      "‘But she’s stupid. I have myself said she is stupid,’ he \n",
      "thought. ‘There is something nasty, something wrong, in \n",
      "the feeling she excites in me. I have been told that her \n",
      "brother Anatole was in love with her and she with him, \n",
      "that there was quite a scandal and that that’s why he was \n",
      "sent away. Hippolyte is her br other... Prince Vasili is her \n",
      "father... It’s bad....’ he reflected, but while he was \n",
      "thinking this (the reflection was still incomplete), he \n",
      "caught himself smiling and was conscious that another \n",
      "line of thought had sprung up, and while thinking of her \n",
      "worthlessness he was also dr eaming of how she would be \n",
      "his wife, how she would love him become quite different, \n",
      "and how all he had thought and heard of her might be \n",
      "false. And he again saw her not as the daughter of Prince \n",
      "Vasili, but visualized her whole body only veiled by its \n",
      "gray dress. ‘But no! Why did this thought never occur to \n",
      "me before?’ and again he told himself that it was \n",
      "impossible, that there would be something unnatural, and \n",
      "as it seemed to him dishonorable, in this marriage. He \n",
      "recalled her former words and looks and the words and \n",

      "had already, in some way, bound himself to do something \n",
      "that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do. But \n",
      "at the very time he was e xpressing this conviction to \n",

      "He wished to take a decision, but felt with dismay that \n",
      "in this matter he lacked that  strength of will which he had \n",

      "of them he made some car eless and agreeable remark \n",
      "except to Pierre and Helene, whose presence he seemed \n",
      "not to notice. He enlivened the whole party. The wax \n",
      "candles burned brightly, the silver and crystal gleamed, so \n",

      "epaulets; servants in scarlet liveries moved round the \n",
      "table, the clatter of plates , knives, and glasses mingled \n",
      "with the animated hum of se veral conversations. At one \n",
      "end of the table, the old chamberlain was heard assuring \n",
      "an old baroness that he love d her passionately, at which \n",
      "she laughed; at the other coul d be heard the story of the \n",
      "misfortunes of some Mary Vi ktorovna or other. At the \n",

      "Imperial Council, at which Sergey Kuzmich Vyazmitinov, \n",
      "the new military governor general of Petersburg, had \n",
      "received and read the then famous rescript of the Emperor \n",

      "478 of 2882 \n",
      "was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would \n",

      "‘Well, and so he never got farther than: ‘Sergey \n",

      "again, but as soon as he uttered ‘Sergey’ he sobbed, ‘Kuz-\n",

      "Everybody laughed a great deal . At the head of the \n",

      "479 of 2882 \n",
      "side by side almost at the bottom of the table, a \n",
      "suppressed smile brightening both their faces, a smile that \n",
      "had nothing to do with Sergey Kuzmich- a smile of \n",
      "bashfulness at their own feeli ngs. But much as all the rest \n",
      "laughed, talked, and joked, much  as they enjoyed their \n",
      "Rhine wine, saute, and ices, and however they avoided \n",

      "unobservant as they seemed of them, one could feel by \n",
      "the occasional glances they gave that the story about \n",
      "Sergey Kuzmich, the laughter, and the food were all a \n",
      "pretense, and that the whole attention of that company \n",
      "was directed to- Pierre an d Helene. Prince Vasili \n",
      "mimicked the sobbing of Sergey Kuzmich and at the same \n",
      "time his eyes glanced toward  his daughter, and while he \n",
      "laughed the expression on his face clearly said: ‘Yes... it’s \n",
      "getting on, it will all be settled today.’ Anna Pavlovna \n",
      "threatened him on behalf of ‘our dear Vyazmitinov,’ and \n",
      "in her eyes, which, for an instant, glanced at Pierre, Prince \n",
      "Vasili read a congratulation on his future son-in-law and \n",
      "on his daughter’s happiness. The old princess sighed \n",
      "sadly as she offered some wine  to the old lady next to her \n",
      "and glanced angrily at her daughter, and her sigh seemed \n",
      "to say: ‘Yes, there’s nothing left for you and me but to sip \n",
      "sweet wine, my dear, now that the time has come for War and Peace  \n",
      "480 of 2882 \n",

      "attraction of a healthy and handsome young man and \n",
      "woman for one another. And this human feeling \n",
      "dominated everything else and soared above all their \n",
      "affected chatter. Jests fell flat, news was not interesting, \n",
      "and the animation was evidently forced. Not only the \n",
      "guests but even the footmen waiting at table seemed to \n",
      "feel this, and they forgot their duties as they looked at the \n",
      "beautiful Helene with her ra diant face and at the red, \n",
      "broad, and happy though uneasy f ace of Pierre. It seemed \n",
      "as if the very light of the candles was focused on those \n",
      "two happy faces alone. \n",
      "Pierre felt that he the center of it all, and this both \n",
      "pleased and embarrassed him. He was like a man entirely \n",
      "absorbed in some occupation.  He did not see, hear, or \n",
      "understand anything clearly. Only  now and then detached \n",
      "ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot \n",
      "unexpectedly through his mind. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "481 of 2882 \n",
      "‘So it is all finished!’ he thought. ‘And how has it all \n",
      "happened? How quickly! Now I know that not because of \n",
      "her alone, nor of myself alone, but because of everyone, it \n",
      "must inevitably come about. They are all expecting it, \n",
      "they are so sure that it will  happen that I cannot, I cannot, \n",
      "disappoint them. But how will it be? I do not know, but it \n",
      "will certainly happen!’ thought Pierre, glancing at those \n",
      "dazzling shoulders close to his eyes. \n",
      "Or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not \n",
      "what. He felt it awkward to attract everyone’s attention \n",
      "and to be considered a lucky man and, with his plain face, \n",
      "to be looked on as a sort of  Paris possessed of a Helen. \n",
      "‘But no doubt it always is and must be so!’ he consoled \n",
      "himself. ‘And besides, what have I done to bring it about? \n",
      "How did it begin? I traveled  from Moscow with Prince \n",
      "Vasili. Then there was nothing. So why should I not stay \n",
      "at his house? Then I played cards with her and picked up \n",
      "her reticule and drove out with her. How did it begin, \n",
      "when did it all come about?’ And here he was sitting by \n",
      "her side as her betrothed, seeing, hearing, feeling her \n",
      "nearness, her breathing, her movements, her beauty. Then \n",
      "it would suddenly seem to him that it was not she but he \n",
      "was so unusually beautiful, and that that was why they all \n",
      "looked so at him, and flattere d by this general admiration War and Peace  \n",
      "482 of 2882 \n",
      "he would expand his chest, raise his head, and rejoice at \n",
      "his good fortune. Suddenly he heard a familiar voice \n",
      "repeating something to him a second time. But Pierre was \n",
      "so absorbed that he did not understand what was said. \n",
      "‘I am asking you when you last heard from Bolkonski,’ \n",
      "repeated Prince Vasili a third time. ‘How absent-minded \n",
      "you are, my dear fellow.’ \n",
      "Prince Vasili smiled, and Pier re noticed that everyone \n",
      "was smiling at him and Helene. ‘Well, what of it, if you \n",
      "all know it?’ thought Pierre. ‘W hat of it? It’s the truth!’ \n",
      "and he himself smiled his gentle childlike smile, and \n",
      "Helene smiled too. \n",
      "‘When did you get the letter? Was it from Olmutz?’ \n",
      "repeated Prince Vasili, who pretended to want to know \n",
      "this in order to settle a dispute. \n",
      "‘How can one talk or think of such trifles?’ thought \n",
      "Pierre. \n",
      "‘Yes, from Olmutz,’ he answered, with a sigh. \n",
      "After supper Pierre with his partner followed the others \n",
      "into the drawing room. The guests began to disperse, \n",
      "some without taking leave of Helene. Some, as if \n",
      "unwilling to distract her from an important occupation, \n",
      "came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away, \n",
      "refusing to let her see them off. The diplomatist preserved \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "483 of 2882 \n",
      "a mournful silence as he left the drawing room. He \n",
      "pictured the vanity of his di plomatic career in comparison \n",
      "with Pierre’s happiness. The old general grumbled at his \n",
      "wife when she asked how his leg was. ‘Oh, the old fool,’ \n",
      "he thought. ‘That Princess Hele ne will be beautiful still \n",
      "when she’s fifty.’ \n",
      "‘I think I may congratulat e you,’ whispered Anna \n",
      "Pavlovna to the old princess, kissing her soundly. ‘If I \n",
      "hadn’t this headache I’d have stayed longer.’ \n",
      "The old princess did not reply, she was tormented by \n",
      "jealousy of her daughter’s happiness. \n",
      "While the guests were taking their leave Pierre \n",
      "remained for a long time alone with Helene in the little \n",
      "drawing room where they we re sitting. He had often \n",
      "before, during the last six weeks, remained alone with her, \n",
      "but had never spoken to her of  love. Now he felt that it \n",
      "was inevitable, but he could not make up his mind to take \n",
      "the final step. He felt asha med; he felt that he was \n",
      "occupying someone else’s place here beside Helene. ‘This \n",
      "happiness is not for you,’ so me inner voice whispered to \n",
      "him. ‘This happiness is for those who have not in them \n",
      "what there is in you.’ \n",
      "But, as he had to say something, he began by asking \n",
      "her whether she was satisfied with the party. She replied \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "484 of 2882 \n",
      "in her usual simple manner that  this name day of hers had \n",
      "been one of the pleasantest she had ever had. \n",
      "Some of the nearest relatives had not yet left. They \n",
      "were sitting in the large drawing room. Prince Vasili came \n",
      "up to Pierre with languid footst eps. Pierre rose and said it \n",
      "was getting late. Prince Vasi li gave him a look of stern \n",
      "inquiry, as though what Pierre had just said was so \n",
      "strange that one could not take it in. But then the \n",
      "expression of severity changed, and he drew Pierre’s hand \n",
      "downwards, made him sit down, and smiled \n",
      "affectionately. \n",
      "‘Well, Lelya?’ he asked, turning instantly to his \n",
      "daughter and addressing her with the carel ess tone of \n",
      "habitual tenderness natural to  parents who have petted \n",
      "their children from babyhood, but which Prince Vasili had \n",
      "only acquired by imitating other parents. \n",
      "And he again turned to Pierre. \n",
      "‘Sergey Kuzmich- From all sides-’ he said, \n",
      "unbuttoning the top button of his waistcoat. \n",
      "Pierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was \n",
      "not the story about Sergey Kuzmich that interested Prince \n",
      "Vasili just then, and Prince Va sili saw that Pierre knew \n",
      "this. He suddenly muttered something and went away. It \n",
      "seemed to Pierre that even the prince was disconcerted. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "485 of 2882 \n",
      "The sight of the discomposure of that old man of the \n",
      "world touched Pierre: he l ooked at Helene and she too \n",
      "seemed disconcerted, and her look seemed to say: ‘Well, \n",
      "it is your own fault.’ \n",
      "‘The step must be taken but I cannot, I cannot!’ \n",
      "thought Pierre, and he ag ain began speaking about \n",
      "indifferent matters, about Sergey Kuzmich, asking what \n",
      "the point of the story was as  he had not heard it properly. \n",
      "Helene answered with a smile that she too had missed it. \n",
      "When Prince Vasili returned to the drawing room, the \n",
      "princess, his wife, was talking in low tones to the elderly \n",
      "lady about Pierre. \n",
      "‘Of course, it is a very bril liant match, but happiness, \n",
      "my dear..’ \n",
      "‘Marriages are made in heaven,’ replied the elderly \n",
      "lady. \n",
      "Prince Vasili passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, \n",
      "and sat down on a sofa in a fa r corner of the room. He \n",
      "closed his eyes and seemed to be dozing. His head sank \n",
      "forward and then he roused himself. \n",
      "‘Aline,’ he said to his wife, ‘go and see what they are \n",
      "about.’ \n",
      "The princess went up to the door, passed by it with a \n",
      "dignified and indifferent air, and glanced into the little War and Peace  \n",
      "486 of 2882 \n",
      "drawing room. Pierre and Helene  still sat talking just as \n",
      "before. \n",
      "‘Still the same,’ she said to her husband. \n",
      "Prince Vasili frowned, twis ting his mouth, his cheeks \n",
      "quivered and his face assumed the coarse, unpleasant \n",
      "expression peculiar to him. Shaking himself, he rose, \n",
      "threw back his head, and with resolute steps went past the \n",
      "ladies into the little drawing room. With quick steps he \n",
      "went joyfully up to Pierre. His face was so unusually \n",
      "triumphant that Pierre rose in alarm on seeing it. \n",
      "‘Thank God!’ said Prince Vasili. ‘My wife has told me \n",
      "everything!- (He put one arm around Pierre and the other \n",
      "around his daughter.)- ‘My dear boy... Lelya... I am very \n",
      "pleased.’ (His voice trembled.) ‘I loved your father... and \n",
      "she will make you a good wife... God bless you!..’ \n",
      "He embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and \n",
      "kissed him with his malodor ous mouth. Tears actually \n",
      "moistened his cheeks. \n",
      "‘Princess, come here!’ he shouted. \n",
      "The old princess came in an d also wept. The elderly \n",
      "lady was using her handkerchi ef too. Pierre was kissed, \n",
      "and he kissed the beautiful Helene’s hand several times. \n",
      "After a while they were left alone again. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "487 of 2882 \n",
      "‘All this had to be and could not be otherwise,’ thought \n",
      "Pierre, ‘so it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad. It \n",
      "is good because it’s definite and one is rid of the old \n",
      "tormenting doubt.’ Pierre held the hand of his betrothed in \n",
      "silence, looking at her beautiful bosom as it rose and fell. \n",
      "‘Helene!’ he said aloud and paused. \n",
      "‘Something special is always said in such cases,’ he \n",
      "thought, but could not remember what it was that people \n",
      "say. He looked at her face. She drew nearer to him. Her \n",
      "face flushed. \n",
      "‘Oh, take those off... those...’ she said, pointing to his \n",
      "spectacles. \n",
      "Pierre took them off, and hi s eyes, besides the strange \n",
      "look eyes have from which spectacles have just been \n",
      "removed, had also a fright ened and inquiring look. He \n",
      "was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it, but with a \n",
      "rapid, almost brutal movement of her head, she \n",
      "intercepted his lips and met th em with her own. Her face \n",
      "struck Pierre, by its a ltered, unpleasantly excited \n",
      "expression. \n",
      "‘It is too late now, it’s done; besides I love her,’ \n",
      "thought Pierre. War and Peace  \n",
      "488 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Je vous aime!’* he said, remembering what has to be \n",

      "his son would be paying him a visit. ‘I am starting on a \n",
      "journey of inspection, and of course I shall think nothing \n",
      "of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the same \n",

      "the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the \n",
      "soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path. The \n",

      "491 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Can a sleigh pass?’ he asked his overseer, a venerable \n",

      "‘The snow is deep. I am having the avenue swept, your \n",

      "The prince bowed his head and went up to the porch. \n",
      "‘God be thanked,’ thought the overseer, ‘the storm has \n",
      "blown over!’ \n",
      "‘It would have been hard to  drive up, your honor,’ he \n",

      "eyes on him, frowning. \n",
      "‘What? A minister? What minister? Who gave orders?’ \n",
      "he said in his shrill, harsh voice. ‘The road is not swept \n",
      "for the princess my daughter, but for a minister! For me, \n",
      "there are no ministers!’ \n",
      "‘Your honor, I thought..’ \n",
      "‘You thought!’ shouted the pr ince, his words coming \n",
      "more and more rapidly and indistinctly. ‘You thought!... \n",
      "Rascals! Blackgaurds!... I’l l teach you to think!’ and \n",
      "lifting his stick he swung it a nd would have hit Alpatych, \n",
      "the overseer, had not the latter instinctively avoided the War and Peace  \n",
      "492 of 2882 \n",

      "But although Alpatych, frightened at his own temerity \n",

      "reason, the prince, though he continued to shout: \n",
      "‘Blackgaurds!... Throw the snow back on the road!’ did \n",

      "Before dinner, Princess Mary and Mademoiselle \n",
      "Bourienne, who knew that the prince was in a bad humor, \n",
      "stood awaiting him; Mademoiselle Bourienne with a \n",
      "radiant face that sa id: ‘I know nothing, I am the same as \n",
      "usual,’ and Princess Mary pa le, frightened, and with \n",
      "downcast eyes. What she found hardest to bear was to \n",
      "know that on such occasions she ought to behave like \n",
      "Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could not. She thought: ‘If I \n",
      "seem not to notice he will th ink that I do not sympathize \n",
      "with him; if I seem sad and out of spirits myself, he will \n",
      "say (as he has done before) that I’m in the dumps.’ \n",

      "‘And the other one is not here. They’ve been telling \n",

      "‘Where is the princess?’ he asked. ‘Hiding?’ \n",
      "‘She is not very well,’ answered Mademoiselle \n",
      "Bourienne with a bright sm ile, ‘so she won’t come down. \n",
      "It is natural in her state.’ \n",
      "‘Hm! Hm!’ muttered the prince, sitting down. \n",
      "His plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing \n",
      "to a spot he flung it away. Tikhon caught it and handed it \n",
      "to a footman. The little prin cess was not unwell, but had \n",
      "such an overpowering fear of the prince that, hearing he \n",
      "was in a bad humor, she had decided not to appear. \n",
      "‘I am afraid for the baby,’ she said to Mademoiselle \n",
      "Bourienne: ‘Heaven knows what a fright might do.’ \n",
      "In general at Bald Hills th e little princess lived in \n",
      "constant fear, and with a sense of antipathy to the old \n",
      "prince which she did not realize because the fear was so \n",
      "much the stronger feeling. Th e prince reciprocated this \n",
      "antipathy, but it was overpowered by his contempt for \n",
      "her. When the little princess had grown accustomed to life \n",
      "at Bald Hills, she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle \n",
      "Bourienne, spent whole days wi th her, asked her to sleep War and Peace  \n",
      "494 of 2882 \n",
      "in her room, and often talked with her about the old prince \n",
      "and criticized him. \n",
      "‘So we are to have visitors, mon prince?’ remarked \n",

      "‘Hm!- his excellency is a puppy.... I got him his \n",

      "the prince became more genial. \n",
      "After dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law. The \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "495 of 2882 \n",
      "She was much altered. She was now plain rather than \n",
      "pretty. Her cheeks had sunk, her lip was drawn up, and \n",
      "her eyes drawn down. \n",
      "‘Yes, I feel a kind of oppression,’ she said in reply to \n",

      "‘Do you want anything?’ \n",

      "‘Yes, your excellency. Forgive me for heaven’s sake... \n",
      "It was only my stupidity.’ \n",
      "‘All right, all right,’ interrupted the prince, and \n",
      "laughing his unnatural way, he stretched out his hand for \n",
      "Alpatych to kiss, and then proceeded to his study. \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "496 of 2882 \n",
      "and absent-mindedly fixed hi s large and handsome eyes. \n",
      "He regarded his whole life as a continual round of \n",
      "amusement which someone for some reason had to \n",
      "provide for him. And he looke d on this visit to a churlish \n",
      "old man and a rich and ugly heiress in the same way. All \n",
      "this might, he thought, turn out very well and amusingly. \n",
      "‘And why not marry her if she really has so much money? \n",
      "That never does any harm,’ thought Anatole. \n",
      "He shaved and scented himself with the care and \n",
      "elegance which had become habitual to him and, his \n",
      "handsome head held high, entered his father’s room with \n",
      "the good-humored and victorious air natural to him. \n",
      "Prince Vasili’s two valets were busy dressing him, and he \n",
      "looked round with much animation and cheerfully nodded \n",
      "to his son as the latter entered, as if to say: ‘Yes, that’s \n",
      "how I want you to look.’ \n",
      "‘I say, Father, joking apart,  is she very hideous?’ \n",
      "Anatole asked, as if continuing a conversation the subject \n",
      "of which had often been mentioned during the journey. \n",
      "‘Enough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be \n",
      "respectful and cautious with the old prince.’ \n",
      "‘If he starts a row I’ll go away,’ said Prince Anatole. ‘I \n",

      "‘Remember, for you everything depends on this.’ \n",

      "497 of 2882 \n",
      "In the meantime, not only was it known in the \n",
      "maidservants’ rooms that the minister and his son had \n",
      "arrived, but the appearance of both had been minutely \n",
      "described. Princess Mary was sitting alone in her room, \n",
      "vainly trying to master her agitation. \n",
      "‘Why did they write, why did Li se tell me about it? It \n",
      "can never happen!’ she said, looking at herself in the \n",
      "glass. ‘How shall I enter the drawing room? Even if I like \n",
      "him I can’t now be myself with him.’ The mere thought of \n",
      "her father’s look filled her with terror. The little princess \n",
      "and Mademoiselle Bourienne had already received from \n",
      "Masha, the lady’s maid, the necessary report of how \n",
      "handsome the minister’s son was, with his rosy cheeks \n",
      "and dark eyebrows, and with what difficulty the father \n",
      "had dragged his legs upstairs  while the son had followed \n",
      "him like an eagle, three step s at a time. Having received \n",
      "this information, the little  princess and Mademoiselle \n",
      "Bourienne, whose chattering voices had reached her from \n",

      "‘You know they’ve come, Ma rie?’ said the little \n",
      "princess, waddling in, and sinking heavily into an \n",
      "armchair. \n",
      "She was no longer in the loose gown she generally \n",
      "wore in the morning, but had on one of her best dresses. War and Peace  \n",
      "498 of 2882 \n",
      "Her hair was carefully done and her face was animated, \n",
      "which, however, did not conceal its sunken and faded \n",
      "outlines. Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, \n",
      "it was still more noticeable how much plainer she had \n",
      "become. Some unobtrusive touch had been added to \n",
      "Mademoiselle Bourienne’s toilet which rendered her fresh \n",
      "and prettyface yet more attractive. \n",
      "‘What! Are you going to remain as you are, dear \n",
      "princess?’ she began. ‘They’ ll be announcing that the \n",
      "gentlemen are in the drawing room and we shall have to \n",
      "go down, and you have not smartened yourself up at all!’ \n",
      "The little princess got up, rang for the maid, and \n",
      "hurriedly and merrily began to devise and carry out a plan \n",
      "of how Princess Mary should be dressed. Princess Mary’s \n",
      "self-esteem was wounded by the fact that the arrival of a \n",
      "suitor agitated her, and s till more so by both her \n",
      "companions’ not having the least conception that it could \n",
      "be otherwise. To tell them that she felt ashamed for \n",
      "herself and for them would be to betray her agitation, \n",
      "while to decline their offers  to dress her would prolong \n",
      "their banter and insistence. She flushed, her beautiful eyes \n",
      "grew dim, red blotches came on her face, and it took on \n",
      "the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore, as \n",
      "she submitted herself to Mademoiselle Bourienne and \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "499 of 2882 \n",
      "Lise. Both these women quite sincerely tried to make her \n",
      "look pretty. She was so plain that neither of them could \n",
      "think of her as a rival, so they began dres sing her with \n",
      "perfect sincerity, and with th e naive and firm conviction \n",
      "women have that dress can make a face pretty. \n",
      "‘No really, my dear, this dress is not pretty,’ said Lise, \n",
      "looking sideways at Princess Ma ry from a lit tle distance. \n",
      "‘You have a maroon dress, ha ve it fetched. Really! You \n",
      "know the fate of your whole life may be at stake. But this \n",
      "one is too light, it’s not becoming!’ \n",
      "It was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of \n",
      "Princess Mary that was not pretty, but neither \n",
      "Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little princess felt this; \n",
      "they still thought that if a bl ue ribbon were placed in the \n",
      "hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged \n",
      "lower on the best maroon dre ss, and so on, all would be \n",
      "well. They forgot that the frightened face and the figure \n",
      "could not be altered, and that however they might change \n",
      "the setting and adornment of  that face, it would still \n",
      "remain piteous and plain. Afte r two or three changes to \n",
      "which Princess Mary meekly submitted, just as her hair \n",
      "had been arranged on the top of  her head (a style that \n",
      "quite altered and spoiled he r looks) and she had put on a \n",
      "maroon dress with a pale-blue scarf, the little princess War and Peace  \n",
      "500 of 2882 \n",
      "walked twice round her, now ad justing a fold of the dress \n",
      "with her little hand, now arra nging the scarf and looking \n",
      "at her with her head  bent first on one side and then on the \n",
      "other. \n",
      "‘No, it will not do,’ she said decidedly, clasping her \n",
      "hands. ‘No, Mary, really this dress does not suit you. I \n",
      "prefer you in your little gray everyday dress. Now please, \n",
      "do it for my sake. Katie,’ she said to the maid, ‘bring the \n",
      "princess her gray dress, a nd you’ll see, Mademoiselle \n",
      "Bourienne, how I shall arrange it,’ she added, smiling \n",
      "with a foretaste of artistic pleasure. \n",
      "But when Katie brought the required dress, Princess \n",
      "Mary remained sitting motionless before the glass, \n",
      "looking at her face, and saw in the mirror her eyes full of \n",
      "tears and her mouth quivering, ready to burst into sobs. \n",
      "‘Come, dear princess,’ said Mademoiselle Bourienne, \n",
      "‘just one more little effort.’ \n",
      "The little princess, taking the dress from the maid, \n",
      "came up to Princess Mary. \n",
      "‘Well, now we’ll arrange something quite simple and \n",
      "becoming,’ she said. \n",
      "The three voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bourienne’s, and \n",
      "Katie’s, who was laughing at something, mingled in a \n",
      "merry sound, like the chirping of birds. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "501 of 2882 \n",
      "‘No, leave me alone,’ said Princess Mary. \n",
      "Her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the \n",
      "chirping of the birds was silenced at once. They looked at \n",
      "the beautiful, large, thoughtful eyes full of tears and of \n",
      "thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at them, and \n",
      "understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist. \n",
      "‘At least, change your coiffure,’ said the little princess. \n",
      "‘Didn’t I tell you,’ she went on, turning reproachfully to \n",
      "Mademoiselle Bourienne, ‘Mary’s is a face which such a \n",
      "coiffure does not suit in the least. Not in the least! Please \n",
      "change it.’ \n",
      "‘Leave me alone, please leave me alone! It is all quite \n",
      "the same to me,’ answered a voice struggling with tears. \n",
      "Mademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to \n",
      "own to themselves that Princess Mary in this guise looked \n",
      "very plain, worse than usual, but it was too late. She was \n",
      "looking at them with an expr ession they both knew, an \n",
      "expression thoughtful and sad. This expression in Princess \n",
      "Mary did not frighten them (she never inspired fear in \n",
      "anyone), but they knew that when it appeared on her face, \n",
      "she became mute and was not to be shaken in her \n",
      "determination. \n",
      "‘You will change it, won’t you?’ said Lise. And as \n",
      "Princess Mary gave no answer, she left the room. War and Peace  \n",
      "502 of 2882 \n",
      "Princess Mary was left alone. She did not comply with \n",
      "Lise’s request, she not only left her hair as it was, but did \n",
      "not even look in her glass. Letting her arms fall \n",
      "helplessly, she sat with downcast eyes and pondered. A \n",
      "husband, a man, a strong dom inant and strangely \n",
      "attractive being rose in her imagination, and carried her \n",
      "into a totally different happy world of his own. She \n",
      "fancied a child, her own- such  as she had seen the day \n",
      "before in the arms of her nurse’s daughter- at her own \n",
      "breast, the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her \n",
      "and the child. ‘But no, it is impossible, I am too ugly,’ she \n",
      "thought. \n",
      "‘Please come to tea. The prince will be out in a \n",
      "moment,’ came the maid’s voice at the door. \n",
      "She roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had \n",
      "been thinking, and before going down she went into the \n",
      "room where the icons hung and, her eyes fixed on the \n",
      "dark face of a large icon of  the Saviour lit by a lamp, she \n",
      "stood before it with folded hands for a few moments. A \n",
      "painful doubt filled her soul. Could the joy of love, of \n",
      "earthly love for a man, be for her? In her thoughts of \n",
      "marriage Princess Mary dreamed of happiness and of \n",
      "children, but her strongest, most deeply hidden longing \n",
      "was for earthly love. The more she tried to hide this \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "503 of 2882 \n",
      "feeling from others and even from herself, the stronger it \n",
      "grew. ‘O God,’ she said, ‘how am I to stifle  in my heart \n",
      "these temptations of the devil? How am I to renounce \n",
      "forever these vile fancies, so as peacefully to fulfill Thy \n",
      "will?’ And scarcely had she put that question than God \n",
      "gave her the answer in her own heart. ‘Desire nothing for \n",
      "thyself, seek nothing, be not  anxious or envious. Man’s \n",
      "future and thy own fate must remain hidden from thee, \n",
      "but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything. If it be \n",
      "God’s will to prove thee in the duties of marriage, be \n",
      "ready to fulfill His will.’ With this consoling thought (but \n",
      "yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly \n",
      "longing) Princess Mary sighed, and having crossed herself \n",
      "went down, thinking neither of her gown and coiffure nor \n",
      "of how she would go in nor of  what she would say. What \n",
      "could all that matter in comparison with the will of God, \n",
      "without Whose care not a hair of man’s head can fall? War and Peace  \n",

      "When Princess Mary came down, Prince Vasili and his \n",
      "son were already in the drawi ng room, talking to the little \n",
      "princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne. When she entered \n",
      "with her heavy step, treading on her heels, the gentlemen \n",
      "and Mademoiselle Bourienne ro se and the little princess, \n",
      "indicating her to the gentlemen, said: ‘Voila Marie!’ \n",
      "Princess Mary saw them all and saw them in detail. She \n",
      "saw Prince Vasili’s face, serious for an instant at the sight \n",
      "of her, but immediately sm iling again, and the little \n",
      "princess curiously noting the impression ‘Marie’ \n",
      "produced on the visitors. And she saw Mademoiselle \n",
      "Bourienne, with her ribbon a nd pretty face, and her \n",
      "unusually animated look which was fixed on him, but him \n",
      "she could not see, she only saw something large, brilliant, \n",
      "and handsome moving toward  her as she entered the \n",
      "room. Prince Vasili approached first, and she kissed the \n",
      "bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his \n",
      "question by saying that, on the contrary, she remembered \n",
      "him quite well. Then Anatole came up to her. She still \n",
      "could not see him. She only fe lt a soft hand taking hers \n",
      "firmly, and she touched with her lips a white forehead, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "505 of 2882 \n",
      "over which was beautiful light-brown hair smelling of \n",
      "pomade. When she looked up at him she was struck by his \n",
      "beauty. Anatole stood with his right thumb under a button \n",
      "of his uniform, his chest expanded and his back drawn in, \n",
      "slightly swinging one foot, and, with his head a little bent, \n",
      "looked with beaming face at the princess without \n",
      "speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all. \n",
      "Anatole was not quick-witted, nor ready or eloquent in \n",
      "conversation, but he had the faculty, so invaluable in \n",
      "society, of composure and im perturbable self-possession. \n",
      "If a man lacking in self-c onfidence remains dumb on a \n",
      "first introduction and betr ays a consciousness of the \n",
      "impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find \n",
      "something to say, the effect is bad. But Anatole was \n",
      "dumb, swung his foot, and smilingly examined the \n",
      "princess’ hair. It was evident that he could be silent in this \n",
      "way for a very long time. ‘If  anyone finds this silence \n",
      "inconvenient, let him talk, but I don’t want to‘‘ he seemed \n",
      "to say. Besides this, in his behavior to women Anatole \n",
      "had a manner which particularly inspires in them \n",
      "curiosity, awe, and even love- a supercilious \n",
      "consciousness of his own superiority. It was was as if he \n",
      "said to them: ‘I know you, I know you, but why should I \n",
      "bother about you? You’d be on ly too glad, of course.’ War and Peace  \n",
      "506 of 2882 \n",
      "Perhaps he did not really think this when he met women- \n",
      "even probably he did not, for in general he thought very \n",
      "little- but his looks and manne r gave that impression. The \n",
      "princess felt this, and as if wishing to show him that she \n",
      "did not even dare expect to interest him, she turned to his \n",
      "father. The conversation was general and animated, \n",
      "thanks to Princess Lise’s voice and little downy lip that \n",
      "lifted over her white teeth. She met Prince Vasili with that \n",
      "playful manner often employed by lively chatty people, \n",
      "and consisting in the assumpti on that between the person \n",
      "they so address and themselves there are some semi-\n",
      "private, long-established jokes and amusing \n",
      "reminiscences, though no such reminiscences really exist- \n",
      "just as none existed in this  case. Prince Vasili readily \n",
      "adopted her tone and the little princess also drew Anatole, \n",
      "whom she hardly knew, into these amusing recollections \n",
      "of things that had never occurred. Mademoiselle \n",
      "Bourienne also shared them and even Princess Mary felt \n",
      "herself pleasantly made to share in these merry \n",
      "reminiscences. \n",
      "‘Here at least we shall have the benefit of your \n",
      "company all to ourselves, dear prince,’ said the little \n",
      "princess (of course, in French ) to Prince Vasili. ‘It’s not \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "507 of 2882 \n",
      "as at Annette’s* receptions where you always ran away; \n",

      "*Anna Pavlovna. \n",
      "‘Ah, but you won’t talk politics to me like Annette!’ \n",
      "‘And our little tea table?’ \n",
      "‘Oh, yes!’ \n",
      "‘Why is it you were never at  Annette’s?’ the little \n",
      "princess asked Anatole. ‘A h, I know, I know,’ she said \n",
      "with a sly glance, ‘your brot her Hippolyte told me about \n",
      "your goings on. Oh!’ and she s hook her finger at him, ‘I \n",
      "have even heard of your doings in Paris!’ \n",
      "‘And didn’t Hippolyte tell you ?’ asked Prince Vasili, \n",
      "turning to his son and seizing the little princess’ arm as if \n",
      "she would have run away and he had just managed to \n",
      "catch her, ‘didn’t he tell you how he himself was pining \n",
      "for the dear princess, and how she showed him the door? \n",
      "Oh, she is a pearl among wo men, Princess,’ he added, \n",
      "turning to Princess Mary. \n",
      "When Paris was mentioned, Mademoiselle Bourienne \n",
      "for her part seized the oppor tunity of joining in the \n",
      "general current of recollections. \n",
      "She took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long \n",
      "since Anatole had left Paris and how he had liked that \n",
      "city. Anatole answered the Frenchwoman very readily \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "508 of 2882 \n",
      "and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her about her \n",
      "native land. When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, \n",
      "Anatole came to the conclu sion that he would not find \n",
      "Bald Hills dull either. ‘Not  at all bad!’ he thought, \n",
      "examining her, ‘not at all bad, that little companion! I \n",
      "hope she will bring her along with her when we’re \n",
      "married, la petite est gentille.’* \n",
      "*The little one is charming. \n",
      "The old prince dressed leisur ely in his study, frowning \n",
      "and considering what he was to do. The coming of these \n",
      "visitors annoyed him. ‘What are Prince Vasili and that son \n",
      "of his to me? Prince Vasili is a shallow braggart and his \n",
      "son, no doubt, is a fine specimen,’ he grumbled to \n",
      "himself. What angered him was that the coming of these \n",
      "visitors revived in his mi nd an unsettled question he \n",
      "always tried to stifle, one about which he always deceived \n",
      "himself. The question was wh ether he could ever bring \n",
      "himself to part from his daughter and give her to a \n",
      "husband. The prince never directly asked himself that \n",
      "question, knowing beforehand that he would have to \n",
      "answer it justly, and justic e clashed not only with his \n",
      "feelings but with the very possi bility of life. Life without \n",
      "Princess Mary, little as he seemed to value her, was \n",
      "unthinkable to him. ‘And why should she marry?’ he \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "509 of 2882 \n",
      "thought. ‘To be unhappy for certain. There’s Lise, \n",
      "married to Andrew- a bette r husband one would think \n",
      "could hardly be found nowad ays- but is she contented \n",
      "with her lot? And who would marry Marie for love? Plain \n",
      "and awkward! They’ll take her for her connections and \n",
      "wealth. Are there no women living unmarried, and even \n",
      "the happier for it?’ So t hought Prince Bolkonski while \n",
      "dressing, and yet the question he was always putting off \n",
      "demanded an immediate answ er. Prince Vasili had \n",
      "brought his son with the evid ent intention of proposing, \n",
      "and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an \n",
      "answer. His birth and position in society were not bad. \n",
      "‘Well, I’ve nothing against it,’ the prince said to himself, \n",
      "‘but he must be worthy of her.  And that is what we shall \n",
      "see.’ \n",
      "‘That is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!’ \n",
      "he added aloud. \n",
      "He entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, \n",
      "glancing rapidly round th e company. He noticed the \n",
      "change in the little princess’ dress, Mademoiselle \n",
      "Bourienne’s ribbon, Princess Mary’s unbecoming \n",
      "coiffure, Mademoiselle Bourienne’s and Anatole’s smiles, \n",
      "and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general \n",
      "conversation. ‘Got herself up like a fool!’ he thought, War and Peace  \n",
      "510 of 2882 \n",
      "looking irritably at her. ‘She is shameless, and he ignores \n",
      "her!’ \n",
      "He went straight up to Prince Vasili. \n",
      "‘Well! How d’ye do? How d’ye do? Glad to see you!’ \n",
      "‘Friendship laughs at distance,’ began Prince Vasili in \n",
      "his usual rapid, self-confident, familiar tone. ‘Here is my \n",
      "second son; please love and befriend him.’ \n",
      "Prince Bolkonski surveyed Anatole. \n",
      "‘Fine young fellow! Fine young fellow!’ he said. \n",
      "‘Well, come and kiss me,’ and he offered his cheek. \n",
      "Anatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with \n",
      "curiosity and perfect  composure, waiti ng for a display of \n",
      "the eccentricities his father had told him to expect. \n",
      "Prince Bolkonski sat down in his usual place in the \n",
      "corner of the sofa and, drawi ng up an armchair for Prince \n",
      "Vasili, pointed to it and began questioning him about \n",
      "political affairs and news. He seemed to listen attentively \n",
      "to what Prince Vasili said, but  kept glancing at Princess \n",
      "Mary. \n",
      "‘And so they are writing from Potsdam already?’ he \n",
      "said, repeating Prince Vasili’s last words. Then rising, he \n",
      "suddenly went up to his daughter. \n",
      "‘Is it for visitors you’ve got yourself up like that, eh?’ \n",
      "said he. ‘Fine, very fine! You have done up your hair in \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "511 of 2882 \n",
      "this new way for the visitors, and before the visitors I tell \n",
      "you that in future you are neve r to dare to change your \n",
      "way of dress without my consent.’ \n",
      "‘It was my fault, mon pere,’ interceded the little \n",
      "princess, with a blush. \n",
      "‘You must do as you please, ’ said Prince Bolkonski, \n",
      "bowing to his daughter-in-law, ‘but she need not make a \n",
      "fool of herself, she’s plain enough as it is.’ \n",
      "And he sat down again, paying no more attention to his \n",
      "daughter, who was reduced to tears. \n",
      "‘On the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very \n",
      "well,’ said Prince Vasili. \n",
      "‘Now you, young prince, what’s your name?’ said \n",
      "Prince Bolkonski, turning to Anatole, ‘come here, let us \n",
      "talk and get acquainted.’ \n",
      "‘Now the fun begins,’ t hought Anatole, sitting down \n",
      "with a smile beside the old prince. \n",
      "‘Well, my dear boy, I hear you’ve been educated \n",
      "abroad, not taught to read and write by the deacon, like \n",
      "your father and me. Now tell  me, my dear boy, are you \n",
      "serving in the Horse Guards?’ asked the old man, \n",
      "scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently. \n",
      "‘No, I have been transferred to  the line,’ said Anatole, \n",
      "hardly able to restrain his laughter. War and Peace  \n",
      "512 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Ah! That’s a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to \n",
      "serve the Tsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine \n",
      "fellow must serve. Well, are you off to the front?’ \n",
      "‘No, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I \n",
      "am attached... what is it I am  attached to, Papa?’ said \n",
      "Anatole, turning to his father with a laugh. \n",
      "‘A splendid soldier, splendid! ‘What am I attached to!’ \n",
      "Ha, ha, ha!’ laughed Prince Bolkonski, and Anatole \n",
      "laughed still louder. Suddenly Prince Bolkonski frowned. \n",
      "‘You may go,’ he said to Anatole. \n",
      "Anatole returned smiling to the ladies. \n",
      "‘And so you’ve had him educated abroad, Prince \n",
      "Vasili, haven’t you?’ said the old prince to Prince Vasili. \n",
      "‘I have done my best for him, and I can assure you the \n",
      "education there is much better than ours.’ \n",
      "‘Yes, everything is different nowadays, everything is \n",
      "changed. The lad’s a fine fe llow, a fine fellow! Well, \n",
      "come with me now.’ He took Prince Vasili’s arm and led \n",
      "him to his study. As soon as they were alone together, \n",
      "Prince Vasili announced his hope s and wishes to the old \n",
      "prince. \n",
      "‘Well, do you think I shall prevent her, that I can’t part \n",
      "from her?’ said the old prince angrily. ‘What an idea! I’m \n",
      "ready for it tomorrow! Only let me tell you,  I want to \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "513 of 2882 \n",
      "know my son-in-law better.  You know my principles- \n",
      "everything aboveboard? I will ask her tomorrow in your \n",
      "presence; if she is willing, then he can stay on. He can \n",
      "stay and I’ll see.’ The old prince snorted. ‘Let her marry, \n",
      "it’s all the same to me!’ he screamed in the same piercing \n",
      "tone as when parting from his son. \n",
      "‘I will tell you frankly,’ said Prince Vasili in the tone \n",
      "of a crafty man convinced of  the futility of being cunning \n",
      "with so keen-sighted companion. ‘You know, you see \n",
      "right through people. Anatole is  no genius, but he is an \n",
      "honest, goodhearted lad; an excellent son or kinsman.’ \n",
      "‘All right, all right, we’ll see!’ \n",
      "As always happens when wo men lead lonely lives for \n",
      "any length of time without ma le society, on Anatole’s \n",
      "appearance all the three wo men of Prince Bolkonski’s \n",
      "household felt that their life ha d not been real till then. \n",
      "Their powers of reasoning, feeling, and observing \n",
      "immediately increased tenfold, and their life, which \n",
      "seemed to have been passed in darkness, was suddenly lit \n",
      "up by a new brightness, full of significance. \n",
      "Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and \n",
      "coiffure. The handsome open face of the man who might \n",
      "perhaps be her husband abso rbed all her attention. He \n",
      "seemed to her kind, brave, determined, manly, and War and Peace  \n",
      "514 of 2882 \n",
      "magnanimous. She felt convinced of that. Thousands of \n",
      "dreams of a future family life continually rose in her \n",
      "imagination. She drove them away and tried to conceal \n",
      "them. \n",
      "‘But am I not too cold with him?’ thought the princess. \n",
      "‘I try to be reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel \n",
      "too near to him already, but  then he cannot know what I \n",
      "think of him and may imagine that I do not like him.’ \n",
      "And Princess Mary tried, but  could not manage, to be \n",
      "cordial to her new guest. ‘Poor  girl, she’s devilish ugly!’ \n",
      "thought Anatole. \n",
      "Mademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to great \n",
      "excitement by Anatole’s arriva l, thought in another way. \n",
      "Of course, she, a handsome young woman without any \n",
      "definite position, without rela tions or even a country, did \n",
      "not intend to devote her life to serving Prince Bolkonski, \n",
      "to reading aloud to him and being friends with Princess \n",
      "Mary. Mademoiselle Bourienne had long been waiting for \n",
      "a Russian prince who, able to appreciate at a glance her \n",
      "superiority to the plain, ba dly dressed, ungainly Russian \n",
      "princesses, would fall in love with her and carry her off; \n",
      "and here at last was a Russian prince. Mademoiselle \n",
      "Bourienne knew a story, heard from her aunt but finished \n",
      "in her own way, which she liked to repeat to herself. It \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "515 of 2882 \n",
      "was the story of a girl w ho had been seduced, and to \n",
      "whom her poor mother (sa pauvre mere) appeared, and \n",
      "reproached her for yieldi ng to a man without being \n",
      "married. Mademoiselle Bourie nne was often touched to \n",
      "tears as in imagination she to ld this story to him, her \n",
      "seducer. And now he, a real Russian prince, had appeared. \n",
      "He would carry her away and then sa pauvre mere would \n",
      "appear and he would marry he r. So her future shaped \n",
      "itself in Mademoiselle Bourienne’s head at the very time \n",
      "she was talking to Anatole about Paris. It was not \n",
      "calculation that guided her (she did not even for a moment \n",
      "consider what she should do) , but all this had long been \n",
      "familiar to her, and now that Anatole had appeared it just \n",
      "grouped itself around him and she wished and tried to \n",
      "please him as much as possible. \n",
      "The little princess, like an old war horse that hears the \n",
      "trumpet, unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, \n",
      "prepared for the familiar gallop of coquetry, without any \n",
      "ulterior motive or any struggle, but with naive and \n",
      "lighthearted gaiety. \n",
      "Although in female society Anatole usually assumed \n",
      "the role of a man tired of being run after by women, his \n",
      "vanity was flattered by the spectacle of his power over \n",
      "these three women. Besides that , he was beginning to feel War and Peace  \n",
      "516 of 2882 \n",
      "for the pretty and provoca tive Mademoiselle Bourienne \n",
      "that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master \n",
      "him with great suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest \n",
      "and most reckless actions. \n",
      "After tea, the company went into the sitting room and \n",
      "Princess Mary was asked to play on the clavichord. \n",
      "Anatole, laughing and in high spirits, came and leaned on \n",
      "his elbows, facing her and beside Mademoiselle \n",
      "Bourienne. Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully \n",
      "joyous emotion. Her favorite sonata bore her into a most \n",
      "intimately poetic world and the look she felt upon her \n",
      "made that world still more poetic. But Anatole’s \n",
      "expression, though his eyes were  fixed on her, referred \n",
      "not to her but to the movements of Mademoiselle \n",
      "Bourienne’s little foot, which he was then touching with \n",
      "his own under the clavichord. Mademoiselle Bourienne \n",
      "was also looking at Princess Ma ry, and in her lovely eyes \n",
      "there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new \n",
      "to the princess. \n",
      "‘How she loves me!’ thought Princess Mary. ‘How \n",
      "happy I am now, and how happy I may be with such a \n",
      "friend and such a husband! Husband? Can it be possible?’ \n",
      "she thought, not daring to look at his face, but still feeling \n",
      "his eyes gazing at her. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "517 of 2882 \n",
      "In the evening, after supper,  when all were about to \n",
      "retire, Anatole kissed Princess Mary’s hand. She did not \n",
      "know how she found the courage,  but she looked straight \n",
      "into his handsome face as it came near to her shortsighted \n",
      "eyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up and kissed \n",
      "Mademoiselle Bourienne’s hand. (This was not etiquette, \n",
      "but then he did everything so simply and with such \n",
      "assurance!) Mademoiselle B ourienne flushed, and gave \n",
      "the princess a frightened look. \n",
      "‘What delicacy! ‘ thought the princess. ‘Is it possible \n",
      "that Amelie’ (Mademoiselle Bourienne) ‘thinks I could be \n",
      "jealous of her, and not value her pure affection and \n",
      "devotion to me?’ She went up to her and kissed her \n",
      "warmly. Anatole went up to kiss the little princess’ hand. \n",
      "‘No! No! No! When your father  writes to tell me that \n",
      "you are behaving well I will give you my hand to kiss. \n",
      "Not till then!’ she said. And smilingly raising a finger at \n",
      "him, she left the room. War and Peace  \n",
      "518 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter V \n",
      "They all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep \n",

      "night. \n",
      "‘Is he really to be my husba nd, this stranger who is so \n",
      "kind- yes, kind, that is the chief thing,’ thought Princess \n",
      "Mary; and fear, which she had seldom experienced, came \n",
      "upon her. She feared to look r ound, it seemed to her that \n",
      "someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark \n",

      "The little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed \n",

      "her side. Every position was awkward and uncomfortable, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "519 of 2882 \n",
      "and her burden oppressed her now more than ever \n",
      "because Anatole’s presence had vividly recalled to her the \n",
      "time when she was not like that and when everything was \n",
      "light and gay. She sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket \n",
      "and nightcap and Katie, sleepy and disheveled, beat and \n",

      "regiments and was annoyed at  the irregularity of a \n",
      "movement. With a pleasant smile Berg related how the \n",
      "Grand Duke had ridden up to him in a violent passion, \n",
      "shouting: ‘Arnauts!’ (\"Arna uts’ was the Tsarevich’s \n",
      "favorite expression when he was in a rage) and called for \n",
      "the company commander. \n",
      "‘Would you believe it, Count, I was not at all alarmed, \n",
      "because I knew I was right. Without boasting, you know, \n",
      "I may say that I know the Army Orders by heart and know \n",
      "the Regulations as well as I do the Lord’s Prayer. So, \n",
      "Count, there never is any negligence in my company, and \n",
      "so my conscience was at eas e. I came forward....’ (Berg \n",
      "stood up and showed how he pr esented himself, with his \n",
      "hand to his cap, and really it would have been difficult for \n",
      "a face to express greater re spect and self-complacency \n",
      "than his did.) ‘Well, he stormed at me, as the saying is, \n",
      "stormed and stormed and stormed! It was not a matter of \n",
      "life but rather of de ath, as the saying is . ‘Albanians!’ and \n",
      "‘devils!’ and ‘To Siberia!’’ said Berg with a sagacious \n",
      "smile. ‘I knew I was in the right  so I kept silent; was not \n",
      "that best, Count?... ‘Hey, are you dumb?’ he shouted. Still War and Peace  \n",
      "550 of 2882 \n",
      "I remained silent. And what do you think, Count? The \n",
      "next day it was not even men tioned in the Orders of the \n",
      "Day. That’s what keeping one’s head means. That’s the \n",
      "way, Count,’ said Berg, lighting his pipe and emitting \n",
      "rings of smoke. \n",
      "‘Yes, that was fine,’ said Rostov, smiling. \n",
      "But Boris noticed that he was preparing to make fun of \n",
      "Berg, and skillfully changed the subject. He asked him to \n",
      "tell them how and where he got his wound. This pleased \n",
      "Rostov and he began talking about it, and as he went on \n",
      "became more and more animated. He told them of his \n",
      "Schon Grabern affair, just as those who have taken part in \n",
      "a battle generally do describe it, that is, as they would like \n",
      "it to have been, as they have  heard it described by others, \n",
      "and as sounds well, but not at all as it really was. Rostov \n",
      "was a truthful young man and would on no account have \n",
      "told a deliberate lie. He be gan his story meaning to tell \n",
      "everything just as it ha ppened, but imperceptibly, \n",
      "involuntarily, and inevitably he  lapsed into falsehood. If \n",
      "he had told the truth to his hearers- who like himself had \n",
      "often heard stories of attack s and had formed a definite \n",
      "idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear just \n",
      "such a story- they would eith er not have believed him or, \n",
      "still worse, would have thought that Rostov was himself \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "551 of 2882 \n",
      "to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of \n",
      "cavalry attacks had not happened to him. He could not tell \n",
      "them simply that everyone went  at a trot and that he fell \n",
      "off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as \n",
      "he could from a Frenchman into the wood. Besides, to tell \n",
      "everything as it really happe ned, it would have been \n",
      "necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what \n",
      "happened. It is very difficult to tell the tr uth, and young \n",
      "people are rarely capable of it. His hearers expected a \n",
      "story of how beside hims elf and all aflame with \n",
      "excitement, he had flown like a storm at the square, cut \n",
      "his way in, slashed right and left, how his saber had tasted \n",
      "flesh and he had fallen exha usted, and so on. And so he \n",
      "told them all that. \n",
      "In the middle of his story, just as he was saying: ‘You \n",
      "cannot imagine what a strange  frenzy one experiences \n",
      "during an attack,’ Prince Andrew, whom Boris was \n",
      "expecting, entered the room. Prince Andrew, who liked to \n",
      "help young men, was flattere d by being asked for his \n",
      "assistance and being well disposed toward Boris, who had \n",
      "managed to please him the day before, he wished to do \n",
      "what the young man wanted. Having been sent with \n",
      "papers from Kutuzov to the Tsarevich, he looked in on \n",
      "Boris, hoping to find him al one. When he came in and War and Peace  \n",
      "552 of 2882 \n",
      "saw an hussar of the line recounting his military exploits \n",
      "(Prince Andrew could not endur e that sort of man), he \n",
      "gave Boris a pleasant smile, frowned as with half-closed \n",
      "eyes he looked at Rostov, bowed slightly and wearily, and \n",
      "sat down languidly on the sofa: he felt it unpleasant to \n",
      "have dropped in on bad co mpany. Rostov flushed up on \n",
      "noticing this, but he did not care, this was a mere stranger. \n",
      "Glancing, however, at Boris, he saw that he too seemed \n",
      "ashamed of the hussar of the line. \n",
      "In spite of Prince Andrew’s disagreeable, ironical tone, \n",
      "in spite of the contempt with which Rostov, from his \n",
      "fighting army point of view, regarded all these little \n",
      "adjutants on the staff of  whom the newcomer was \n",
      "evidently one, Rostov felt confused, blushed, and became \n",
      "silent. Boris inquired what news there might be on the \n",
      "staff, and what, without indi scretion, one might ask about \n",
      "our plans. \n",
      "‘We shall probably advan ce,’ replied Bolkonski, \n",
      "evidently reluctant to say more in the presence of a \n",
      "stranger. \n",
      "Berg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, \n",
      "whether, as was rumored, the allowance of forage money \n",
      "to captains of companies would be doubled. To this \n",
      "Prince Andrew answered with a smile that he could give \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "553 of 2882 \n",
      "no opinion on such an important government order, and \n",

      "‘As to your business,’ Prince Andrew continued, \n",
      "addressing Boris, ‘we will talk of it later’ (and he looked \n",

      "will do what is possible.’ \n",
      "And, having glanced round the room, Prince Andrew \n",
      "turned to Rostov, whose state of unconquerable childish \n",
      "embarrassment now changing to anger he did not \n",
      "condescend to notice, and sa id: ‘I think you were talking \n",
      "of the Schon Grabern affair? Were you there?’ \n",
      "‘I was there,’ said Rostov angrily, as if intending to \n",
      "insult the aide-de-camp. \n",
      "Bolkonski noticed the hussar’s state of mind, and it \n",
      "amused him. With a slightly contemptuous smile, he said: \n",
      "‘Yes, there are many stories now told about that affair!’ \n",
      "‘Yes, stories!’ repeated Ro stov loudly, looking with \n",
      "eyes suddenly grown furious , now at Boris, now at \n",
      "Bolkonski. ‘Yes, many storie s! But our stories are the \n",
      "stories of men who have been under the enemy’s fire! Our \n",
      "stories have some weight, not  like the stories of those \n",
      "fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing \n",
      "anything!’ War and Peace  \n",
      "554 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Of whom you imagine me to  be one?’ said Prince \n",
      "Andrew, with a quiet and particularly amiable smile. \n",
      "A strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for \n",
      "this man’s self-possession mi ngled at that moment in \n",
      "Rostov’s soul. \n",
      "‘I am not talking about you,’ he said, ‘I don’t know \n",

      "‘And I will tell you this,’ Prince Andrew interrupted in \n",

      "ready to agree with you that it  would be very easy to do \n",
      "so if you haven’t sufficient self-respect, but admit that the \n",
      "time and place are very badly c hosen. In a day or two we \n",

      "friend of yours, is not at all to blame that my face has the \n",
      "misfortune to displease you. However,’ he added rising, \n",
      "‘you know my name and wh ere to find me, but don’t \n",
      "forget that I do not regard ei ther myself or you as having \n",

      "Only when Prince Andrew was gone did Rostov think \n",
      "of what he ought to have said. And he was still more \n",
      "angry at having omitted to say it. He ordered his horse at \n",
      "once and, coldly taking leave of Boris, rode home. Should \n",
      "he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected \n",
      "adjutant, or really let the matter drop, was the question \n",

      "The day after Rostov had been to see Boris, a review \n",
      "was held of the Austrian and Russian troops, both those \n",

      "campaigning under Kutuzov. The two Emperors, the \n",
      "Russian with his heir the Tsarevich, and the Austrian with \n",

      "gray horses; then again, sp reading out with  the brazen \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "557 of 2882 \n",
      "in full parade uniforms, with their thin or thick waists \n",
      "drawn in to the utmost, their red necks squeezed into their \n",

      "not only the elegant, pomaded officers, but every soldier \n",

      "clean and polished to the utmost, and every horse \n",
      "groomed till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its \n",

      "general and every soldier was conscious of his own \n",
      "insignificance, aware of being but a drop in that ocean of \n",
      "men, and yet at the same time was conscious of his \n",
      "strength as a part of that enormous whole. \n",
      "From early morning strenuous  activities and efforts \n",
      "had begun and by ten o’clock all had been brought into \n",
      "due order. The ranks were drown up on the vast field. The \n",

      "front, behind it the artillery, and behind that again the \n",
      "infantry. \n",
      "A space like a street was left between each two lines of \n",

      "Pavlograds on the right flank of  the front); those recently \n",
      "arrived from Russia, both Gu ards and regiments of the War and Peace  \n",
      "558 of 2882 \n",
      "line; and the Austrian troops. But they all stood in the \n",
      "same lines, under one command, and in a like order. \n",
      "Like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper: ‘They’re \n",
      "coming! They’re coming!’ Alarmed voices were heard, \n",
      "and a stir of final preparation swept over all the troops. \n",
      "From the direction of Olmutz in front of them, a group \n",
      "was seen approaching. And at that moment, though the \n",
      "day was still, a light gust of wind blowing over the army \n",
      "slightly stirred the streamers on the lances and the \n",
      "unfolded standards fluttered ag ainst their staffs. It looked \n",
      "as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing \n",
      "its joy at the approach of  the Emperors. One voice was \n",
      "heard shouting: ‘Eyes front!’ Then, like the crowing of \n",
      "cocks at sunrise, this was repe ated by others from various \n",
      "sides and all became silent. \n",
      "In the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was \n",
      "heard. This was the Emperors’ suites. The Emperors rode \n",
      "up to the flank, and the trumpets of the first cavalry \n",
      "regiment played the general march. It seemed as though \n",
      "not the trumpeters were playi ng, but as if the army itself, \n",
      "rejoicing at the Emperors’ a pproach, had naturally burst \n",
      "into music. Amid these s ounds, only the youthful kindly \n",
      "voice of the Emperor Alexander was clearly heard. He \n",
      "gave the words of greeting, and the first regiment roared \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "559 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Hurrah!’ so deafeningly, continuously, and joyfully that \n",

      "Rostov, standing in the front lines of Kutuzov’s army \n",

      "passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this \n",
      "triumph. \n",

      "mass (and he himself an insignificant atom in it) would go \n",
      "through fire and water, commit crime, die, or perform \n",
      "deeds of highest heroism, and so he could not but tremble \n",
      "and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word. \n",

      "stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar. \n",
      "Till the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and \n",
      "immobility seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he \n",
      "came up it became alive, its thunder joining the roar of the \n",

      "560 of 2882 \n",
      "square masses of troops standi ng motionless as if turned \n",
      "to stone, hundreds of riders composing the suites moved \n",
      "carelessly but symmetrically and above all freely, and in \n",
      "front of them two men- the Emperors. Upon them the \n",
      "undivided, tensely passionate attention of that whole mass \n",
      "of men was concentrated. \n",
      "The handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the \n",

      "Rostov was not far from the trumpeters, and with his \n",

      "Nicholas could clearly dis tinguish every detail of his \n",
      "handsome, happy young face, he experienced a feeling \n",
      "tenderness and ecstasy such as he had never before \n",
      "known. Every trait and every movement of the Tsar’s \n",

      "Stopping in front of the Pavlograds, the Tsar said \n",
      "something in French to the Austrian Emperor and smiled. \n",
      "Seeing that smile, Rostov involuntarily smiled himself \n",
      "and felt a still stronger flow of love for his sovereign. He \n",

      "561 of 2882 \n",
      "this was impossible was ready to cry. The Tsar called the \n",
      "colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him. \n",
      "‘Oh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor \n",
      "spoke to me?’ thought Rostov. ‘I should die of \n",
      "happiness!’ \n",
      "The Tsar addressed the officers also: ‘I thank you all, \n",
      "gentlemen, I thank you with my  whole heart.’ To Rostov \n",

      "gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar! \n",
      "‘You have earned the St. Geor ge’s standards and will \n",
      "be worthy of them.’ \n",

      "as if undecided. \n",

      "562 of 2882 \n",
      "That hesitation lasted only an instant. The Tsar’s foot, \n",
      "in the narrow pointed  boot then fashi onable, touched the \n",
      "groin of the bobtailed bay ma re he rode, his hand in a \n",
      "white glove gathered up th e reins, and he moved off \n",
      "accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides-de-\n",
      "camp. Farther and farther he rode away, stopping at other \n",
      "regiments, till at last only his white plumes were visible to \n",
      "Rostov from amid the suites that surrounded the \n",
      "Emperors. \n",
      "Among the gentlemen of the suite, Rostov noticed \n",

      "It was late in the evening when they entered the palace \n",

      "That same day a council of war had been held in which \n",

      "would certainly result from it- no longer seemed to be in \n",
      "the future but in the past. All the advantages were on our \n",
      "side. Our enormous forces, undoubtedly superior to \n",

      "said nothing to Boris and, evidently unable to suppress the War and Peace  \n",
      "572 of 2882 \n",
      "thoughts which were uppermost in his mind at that \n",

      "‘What can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on... merely to \n",
      "gain time. I tell you he is in our hands, that’s certain! But \n",
      "what was most amusing,’ he continued, w ith a sudden, \n",
      "good-natured laugh, ‘was that we could not think how to \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "573 of 2882 \n",
      "address the reply! If not as ‘Consul’ and of course not as \n",

      "Bonaparte.’’ \n",
      "‘But between not recognizing him as Emperor and \n",
      "calling him General Bonaparte, there is a difference,’ \n",
      "remarked Bolkonski. \n",
      "‘That’s just it,’ interrupted Dolgorukov quickly, \n",
      "laughing. ‘You know Bilibin- he’s a very clever fellow. \n",
      "He suggested addressing him as ‘Usurper and Enemy of \n",
      "Mankind.’’ \n",

      "‘Only that?’ said Bolkonski. \n",
      "‘All the same, it was Bilibin who found a suitable form \n",

      "‘What was it?’ \n",
      "‘To the Head of the French Government... Au chef du \n",

      "satisfaction. ‘Good, wasn’t it?’ \n",
      "‘Yes, but he will dislike it extremely,’ said Bolkonski. \n",
      "‘Oh yes, very much! My brother knows him, he’s \n",
      "dined with him- the present Emperor- more than once in \n",
      "Paris, and tells me he never met a more cunning or subtle \n",
      "diplomatist- you know, a combination of French \n",
      "adroitness and Italian play-a cting! Do you know the tale War and Peace  \n",
      "574 of 2882 \n",
      "about him and Count Markov ? Count Markov was the \n",
      "only man who knew how to handle him. You know the \n",
      "story of the handkerchief? It is delightful!’ \n",
      "And the talkative Dolgorukov, turning now to Boris, \n",
      "now to Prince Andrew, told how Bonaparte wishing to \n",
      "test Markov, our ambassador, purposely dropped a \n",
      "handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at Markov, \n",
      "probably expecting Markov to pick it up for him, and how \n",
      "Markov immediately dropped his own beside it and \n",
      "picked it up without touching Bonaparte’s. \n",
      "‘Delightful!’ said Bolkonski. ‘But I have come to you, \n",
      "Prince, as a petitioner on behalf of this young man. You \n",
      "see...’ but before Prince Andrew could finish, an aide-de-\n",
      "camp came in to summon Dolgorukov to the Emperor. \n",
      "‘Oh, what a nuisance,’ said Dolgorukov, getting up \n",
      "hurriedly and pressing the hands of Prince Andrew and \n",
      "Boris. ‘You know I should be very glad to do all in my \n",
      "power both for you and for this dear young man.’ Again \n",
      "he pressed the hand of the la tter with an expression of \n",
      "good-natured, sincere, and animated levity. ‘But you see... \n",
      "another time!’ \n",
      "Boris was excited by the thought  of being so close to \n",
      "the higher powers as he felt himself to be at that moment. \n",
      "He was conscious that here he was in contact with the \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "575 of 2882 \n",
      "springs that set in motion the enormous movements of the \n",
      "mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny, \n",
      "obedient, and insignificant atom. They followed Prince \n",
      "Dolgorukov out into the corri dor and met- coming out of \n",
      "the door of the Emperor’s room by which Dolgorukov \n",
      "had entered- a short man in civilian clothes with a clever \n",
      "face and sharply projecting jaw which, without spoiling \n",
      "his face, gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of \n",
      "expression. This short man nodded to Dolgorukov as to an \n",
      "intimate friend and stared at Prince Andrew with cool \n",
      "intensity, walking straight toward him and evidently \n",
      "expecting him to bow or to step out of his way. Prince \n",
      "Andrew did neither: a look of animosity appeared on his \n",
      "face and the other turned away and went down the side of \n",
      "the corridor. \n",
      "‘Who was that?’ asked Boris. \n",
      "‘He is one of the most re markable, but to me most \n",
      "unpleasant of men- the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince \n",
      "Adam Czartoryski.... It is such  men as he who decide the \n",
      "fate of nations,’ added Bolkonski with a sigh he could not \n",
      "suppress, as they passed out of the palace. \n",
      "Next day, the army began its campaign, and up to the \n",
      "very battle of Austerlitz, Boris was unable to see either War and Peace  \n",
      "576 of 2882 \n",

      "At dawn on the sixteenth of November, Denisov’s \n",
      "squadron, in which Nicholas Rostov served and which \n",
      "was in Prince Bagration’s de tachment, moved from the \n",
      "place where it had spent the ni ght, advancing into action \n",
      "as arranged, and after going behind other columns for \n",
      "about two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad. \n",
      "Rostov saw the Cossacks and th en the first and second \n",
      "squadrons of hussars and infa ntry battalions and artillery \n",
      "pass by and go forward and then Generals Bagration and \n",
      "Dolgorukov ride past with their adjutants. All the fear \n",
      "before action which he had e xperienced as previously, all \n",
      "the inner struggle to conquer th at fear, all his dreams of \n",
      "distinguishing himself as a true  hussar in this battle, had \n",
      "been wasted. Their squadron remained in reserve and \n",
      "Nicholas Rostov spent that day in a dull and wretched \n",
      "mood. At nine in the morning, he heard firing in front and \n",
      "shouts of hurrah, and saw w ounded being brought back \n",
      "(there were not many of them),  and at last he saw how a \n",
      "whole detachment of French cavalry was brought in, \n",
      "convoyed by a sontnya of Cossacks. Evidently the affair \n",
      "was over and, though not big, had been a successful War and Peace  \n",
      "578 of 2882 \n",
      "engagement. The men and officers returning spoke of a \n",
      "brilliant victory, of the occupation of the town of Wischau \n",
      "and the capture of a whole French squadron. The day was \n",
      "bright and sunny after a sharp night frost, and the cheerful \n",
      "glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of \n",
      "victory which was conveye d, not only by the tales of \n",
      "those who had taken part in it, but also by the joyful \n",
      "expression on the faces of soldiers, officers, generals, and \n",
      "adjutants, as they passed Rostov going or coming. And \n",
      "Nicholas, who had vainly suffered all the dread that \n",
      "precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in \n",
      "inactivity, was all the more depressed. \n",
      "‘Come here, Wostov. Let’ s dwink to dwown our \n",

      "roadside with a flask and some food. \n",
      "The officers gathered round Denisov’s canteen, eating \n",
      "and talking. \n",
      "‘There! They are bringing another!’ cried one of the \n",
      "officers, indicating a captive French dragoon who was \n",
      "being brought in on foot by two Cossacks. \n",
      "One of them was leading by the bridle a fine large \n",

      "‘If you like, your honor!’ \n",
      "The officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and \n",
      "their prisoner. The French dragoon was a young Alsatian \n",
      "who spoke French with a German accent. He was \n",
      "breathless with agitation, his face was red, and when he \n",
      "heard some French spoken he at once began speaking to \n",
      "the officers, addressing first one , then another. He said he \n",
      "would not have been taken, it  was not his fault but the \n",
      "corporal’s who had sent him to seize some horsecloths, \n",
      "though he had told him the Russians were there. And at \n",
      "every word he added: ‘But don’t hurt my little horse!’ and \n",
      "stroked the animal. It was plain that he did not quite grasp \n",
      "where he was. Now he excused himself for having been \n",
      "taken prisoner and now, imagining himself before his own \n",
      "officers, insisted on his soldierly discipline and zeal in the \n",
      "service. He brought with him into our rearguard all the \n",

      "but because as he drew near everything grew brighter, \n",
      "more joyful, more significant, and more festive around \n",

      "coarse, and revolting that hi s proximity to the Emperor \n",

      "the horse’s side with the s pur, and how the well-trained \n",

      "songs resounded even more merrily than on the previous \n",

      "evening to the enemy’s picket line to reconnoiter \n",
      "personally, and twice to the Emperors, Russian and \n",
      "Austrian, to report and expl ain, and to his headquarters War and Peace  \n",
      "596 of 2882 \n",
      "where he had dictated the di spositions in German, and \n",
      "now, much exhausted, he arrived at Kutuzov’s. \n",
      "He was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be \n",
      "polite to the commander in chief. He interrupted him, \n",
      "talked rapidly and indistinctly, without looking at the man \n",
      "he was addressing, and did not reply to questions put to \n",
      "him. He was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful, \n",
      "weary, and distracted air, though at the same time he was \n",
      "haughty and self-confident. \n",
      "Kutuzov was occupying a nobleman’s castle of modest \n",
      "dimensions near Ostralitz. In the large drawing room \n",
      "which had become the commander in chief’s office were \n",
      "gathered Kutuzov himself, Weyrother, and the members \n",
      "of the council of war. They were drinking tea, and only \n",
      "awaited Prince Bagration to begin the council. At last \n",
      "Bagration’s orderly came with the news that the prince \n",
      "could not attend. Prince Andrew came in to inform the \n",
      "commander in chief of this and, availing himself of \n",
      "permission previously given him by Kutuzov to be \n",
      "present at the council, he remained in the room. \n",
      "‘Since Prince Bagration is not coming, we may begin,’ \n",
      "said Weyrother, hurriedly ri sing from his seat and going \n",
      "up to the table on which an enormous map of the environs \n",
      "of Brunn was spread out. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "597 of 2882 \n",
      "Kutuzov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat \n",
      "neck bulged over his collar as if escaping, was sitting \n",
      "almost asleep in a low chair, with his podgy old hands \n",
      "resting symmetrically on its arms. At the sound of \n",
      "Weyrother’s voice, he opened his one eye with an effort. \n",
      "‘Yes, yes, if you please! It is already late,’ said he, and \n",
      "nodding his head he let it droop and again closed his eye. \n",
      "If at first the members of  the council thought that \n",
      "Kutuzov was pretending to  sleep, the sounds his nose \n",
      "emitted during the reading that followed proved that the \n",
      "commander in chief at that moment was absorbed by a far \n",
      "more serious matter than a de sire to show his contempt \n",
      "for the dispositions or anything else- he was engaged in \n",
      "satisfying the irresistible human need for sleep. He really \n",
      "was asleep. Weyrother, with the gesture of a man too busy \n",
      "to lose a moment, glanced  at Kutuzov and, having \n",
      "convinced himself that he was asleep, took up a paper and \n",
      "in a loud, monotonous voice  began to read out the \n",
      "dispositions for the impending battle, under a heading \n",
      "which he also read out: \n",
      "‘Dispositions for an attack on the enemy position \n",
      "behind Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz, November 30, 1805.’ \n",
      "The dispositions were very complicated and difficult. \n",
      "They began as follows: War and Peace  \n",
      "598 of 2882 \n",
      "‘As the enemy’s left wing rests on wooded hills and \n",
      "his right extends along Kobe lnitz and Sokolnitz behind \n",
      "the ponds that are there, while we, on the other hand, with \n",
      "our left wing by far outflank his right, it is advantageous \n",
      "to attack the enemy’s latter wing especially if we occupy \n",
      "the villages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz, whereby we can \n",
      "both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain \n",
      "between Schlappanitz and the Thuerassa forest, avoiding \n",
      "the defiles of Schlappanitz and Bellowitz which cover the \n",
      "enemy’s front. For this object it is necessary that... The \n",
      "first column marches... The second column marches... \n",
      "The third column marches...’ and so on, read Weyrother. \n",
      "The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the \n",
      "difficult dispositions. The tall, fair-haired General \n",
      "Buxhowden stood, leaning his b ack against the wall, his \n",
      "eyes fixed on a burning candle,  and seemed not to listen \n",
      "or even to wish to be thought to listen. Exactly opposite \n",
      "Weyrother, with his glistening wide-open eyes fixed upon \n",
      "him and his mustache twisted upwards, sat the ruddy \n",
      "Miloradovich in a military pose, his elbows turned \n",
      "outwards, his hands on hi s knees, and his shoulders \n",
      "raised. He remained stubbornly silent, gazing at \n",
      "Weyrother’s face, and only turned away his eyes when the \n",
      "Austrian chief of staff finished reading. Then \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "599 of 2882 \n",
      "Miloradovich looked round si gnificantly at the other \n",
      "generals. But one could not tell  from that significant look \n",
      "whether he agreed or disagr eed and was satisfied or not \n",
      "with the arrangements. Next to Weyrother sat Count \n",
      "Langeron who, with a subtle smile that never left his \n",
      "typically southern French face during the whole time of \n",
      "the reading, gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly \n",
      "twirled by its corners a gold snuffbox on which was a \n",
      "portrait. In the middle of one of the longest sentences, he \n",
      "stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox, raised his head, \n",
      "and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his \n",
      "thin lips interrupted Weyrother, wishing to say something. \n",
      "But the Austrian general, continuing to read, frowned \n",
      "angrily and jerked his elbows, as if to say: ‘You can tell \n",
      "me your views later, but now be so good as to look at the \n",
      "map and listen.’ Langeron lifted his eyes with an \n",
      "expression of perplexity, turned round to Miloradovich as \n",
      "if seeking an explanation, but meeting the latter’s \n",
      "impressive but meaningless gaze drooped his eyes sadly \n",
      "and again took to twirling his snuffbox. \n",
      "‘A geography lesson!’ he muttered as if to himself, but \n",
      "loud enough to be heard. \n",
      "Przebyszewski, with resp ectful but dignified \n",
      "politeness, held his hand to his ear toward Weyrother, War and Peace  \n",
      "600 of 2882 \n",
      "with the air of a man absorbed in attention. Dohkturov, a \n",
      "little man, sat opposite Weyrother, with an assiduous and \n",
      "modest mien, and stooping over the outspread map \n",
      "conscientiously studied th e dispositions and the \n",
      "unfamiliar locality. He asked Weyrother several times to \n",
      "repeat words he had not clearly heard and the difficult \n",
      "names of villages. Weyrot her complied and Dohkturov \n",
      "noted them down. \n",
      "When the reading which lasted more than an hour was \n",
      "over, Langeron again brought his snuffbox to rest and, \n",
      "without looking at Weyrother or at anyone in particular, \n",
      "began to say how difficult it was to carry out such a plan \n",
      "in which the enemy’s position was assumed to be known, \n",
      "whereas it was perhaps not known, since the enemy was \n",
      "in movement. Langeron’s objections were valid but it was \n",
      "obvious that their chief aim was to show General \n",
      "Weyrother- who had read his dispositions with as much \n",
      "self-confidence as if he were  addressing school children- \n",
      "that he had to do, not with fools, but with men who could \n",
      "teach him something in military matters. \n",
      "When the monotonous sound of Weyrother’s voice \n",
      "ceased, Kutuzov opened his eye as a miller wakes up \n",
      "when the soporific drone of the mill wheel is interrupted. \n",
      "He listened to what Langeron said, as if remarking, ‘So \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "601 of 2882 \n",
      "you are still at that silly business!’ quickly closed his eye \n",
      "again, and let his head sink still lower. \n",
      "Langeron, trying as virulently as possible to sting \n",
      "Weyrother’s vanity as author of the military plan, argued \n",
      "that Bonaparte might easily attack instead of being \n",
      "attacked, and so render the w hole of this pl an perfectly \n",
      "worthless. Weyrother met all objections with a firm and \n",
      "contemptuous smile, evidently prepared beforehand to \n",
      "meet all objections be they what they might. \n",
      "‘If he could attack us, he would have done so today,’ \n",
      "said he. \n",
      "‘So you think he is powerless?’ said Langeron. \n",
      "‘He has forty thousand men at most,’ replied \n",
      "Weyrother, with the smile of  a doctor to whom an old \n",
      "wife wishes to explain the treatment of a case. \n",
      "‘In that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our \n",
      "attack,’ said Langeron, with a subtly ironical smile, again \n",
      "glancing round for support to Miloradovich who was near \n",
      "him. \n",
      "But Miloradovich was at that moment evidently \n",
      "thinking of anything rather than of what the generals were \n",
      "disputing about. \n",
      "‘Ma foi!’ said he, ‘tomorrow we shall see all that on \n",
      "the battlefield.’ War and Peace  \n",
      "602 of 2882 \n",
      "Weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say \n",
      "that to him it was strange and ridiculous to meet \n",
      "objections from Russian generals  and to have to prove to \n",
      "them what he had not merely convinced himself of, but \n",
      "had also convinced the sovereign Emperors of. \n",
      "‘The enemy has quenched his fires and a continual \n",
      "noise is heard from his camp,’ said he. ‘What does that \n",
      "mean? Either he is retreating, which is the only thing we \n",
      "need fear, or he is cha nging his position.’ (He smiled \n",
      "ironically.) ‘But even if he also took up a position in the \n",
      "Thuerassa, he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and \n",
      "all our arrangements to the minutest detail remain the \n",
      "same.’ \n",
      "‘How is that?...’ began Prince Andrew, who had for \n",
      "long been waiting an opportunity to express his doubts. \n",
      "Kutuzov here woke up, coughed heavily, and looked \n",
      "round at the generals. \n",
      "‘Gentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrow- or rather \n",
      "for today, for it is past mi dnight- cannot now be altered,’ \n",
      "said he. ‘You have heard them, and we shall all do our \n",
      "duty. But before a battle, there is nothing more \n",
      "important...’ he paused, ‘than to have a good sleep.’ \n",
      "He moved as if to rise. The generals bowed and retired. \n",
      "It was past midnight. Prince Andrew went out. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "603 of 2882 \n",
      "The council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not \n",
      "been able to express his opinion as he had hoped to, left \n",
      "on him a vague and uneasy impression. Whether \n",
      "Dolgorukov and Weyrother, or Kutuzov, Langeron, and \n",
      "the others who did not approve of the plan of attack, were \n",
      "right- he did not know. ‘But was it really not possible for \n",
      "Kutuzov to state his views plai nly to the Emperor? Is it \n",
      "possible that on account of court and personal \n",
      "considerations tens of thousands of lives, and my life, my \n",
      "life,’ he thought, ‘must be risked?’ \n",
      "‘Yes, it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow,’ \n",
      "he thought. And suddenly, at this thought of death, a \n",
      "whole series of most distant, most intimate, memories \n",
      "rose in his imagination: he remembered his last parting \n",
      "from his father and his wife; he remembered the days \n",
      "when he first loved her. He  thought of her pregnancy and \n",
      "felt sorry for her and for himself, and in a nervously \n",
      "emotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in \n",
      "which he was billeted with Nesvitski and began to walk \n",
      "up and down before it. \n",
      "The night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight \n",
      "gleamed mysteriously. ‘Yes, tomorrow, tomorrow!’ he \n",
      "thought. ‘Tomorrow everything may be over for me! All \n",
      "these memories will be no more, none of them will have \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "604 of 2882 \n",
      "any meaning for me. Tomorrow perhaps, even certainly, I \n",
      "have a presentiment that for the first time I shall have to \n",
      "show all I can do.’ And his fa ncy pictured the battle, its \n",
      "loss, the concentration of fi ghting at one point, and the \n",
      "hesitation of all the commanders. And then that happy \n",
      "moment, that Toulon for which he had so long waited, \n",
      "presents itself to him at last. He firmly and clearly \n",
      "expresses his opinion to Kutu zov, to Weyrother, and to \n",
      "the Emperors. All are struck by the justness of his views, \n",
      "but no one undertakes to carry  them out, so he takes a \n",
      "regiment, a division- stipulates  that no one is to interfere \n",
      "with his arrangements- leads his division to the decisive \n",
      "point, and gains the victor y alone. ‘But death and \n",
      "suffering?’ suggested anot her voice. Prince Andrew, \n",
      "however, did not answer that voice and went on dreaming \n",
      "of his triumphs. The dispositions for the next battle are \n",
      "planned by him alone. Nominally  he is only an adjutant \n",
      "on Kutuzov’s staff, but he  does everything alone. The \n",
      "next battle is won by him alone. Kutuzov is removed and \n",
      "he is appointed... ‘Well and th en?’ asked the other voice. \n",
      "‘If before that you are not ten times wounded, killed, or \n",
      "betrayed, well... what then? ...’ ‘Well then,’ Prince \n",
      "Andrew answered himself,  ‘I don’t know what will \n",
      "happen and don’t want to know, and can’t, but if I want \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "605 of 2882 \n",
      "this- want glory, want to be known to men, want to be \n",
      "loved by them, it is not my fa ult that I want it and want \n",
      "nothing but that and live only for that. Yes, for that alone! \n",
      "I shall never tell anyone, but, oh God! what am I to do if I \n",
      "love nothing but fame and men’s esteem? Death, wounds, \n",
      "the loss of family- I fear not hing. And precious and dear \n",
      "as many persons are to me- father, sister, wife- those \n",
      "dearest to me- yet dreadful and unnatural as it seems, I \n",
      "would give them all at once for a moment of glory, of \n",
      "triumph over men, of love from men I don’t know and \n",
      "never shall know, for the love  of these men here,’ he \n",
      "thought, as he listened to voices  in Kutuzov’s courtyard. \n",
      "The voices were those of the orderlies who were packing \n",
      "up; one voice, probably a coachman’s, was teasing \n",
      "Kutuzov’s old cook whom Prince Andrew knew, and who \n",
      "was called Tit. He was saying, ‘Tit, I say, Tit!’ \n",
      "‘Well?’ returned the old man. \n",
      "‘Go, Tit, thresh a bit!’ said the wag. \n",
      "‘Oh, go to the devil!’ called out a voice, drowned by \n",
      "the laughter of the orderlies and servants. \n",
      "‘All the same, I love and value nothing but triumph \n",
      "over them all, I value this mystic power and glory that is \n",
      "floating here above me in this mist!’ War and Peace  \n",
      "606 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XIII \n",
      "That same night, Rostov was with a platoon on \n",
      "skirmishing duty in front of Bagration’s detachment. His \n",
      "hussars were placed along the line in couples and he \n",
      "himself rode along the line tryi ng to master the sleepiness \n",
      "that kept coming over him. An enormous space, with our \n",
      "army’s campfires dimly glowing in the fog, co uld be seen \n",
      "behind him; in front of hi m was misty darkness. Rostov \n",
      "could see nothing, peer as he would into that foggy \n",
      "distance: now something gl eamed gray, now there was \n",
      "something black, now little lights seemed to glimmer \n",
      "where the enemy ought to be, now he fancied it was only \n",
      "something in his own eyes. His eyes kept closing, and in \n",
      "his fancy appeared- now the Emperor, now Denisov, and \n",
      "now Moscow memories- and he again hurriedly opened \n",
      "his eyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the \n",
      "horse he was riding, and sometimes, when he came within \n",
      "six paces of them, the black fi gures of hussars, but in the \n",
      "distance was still the same misty darkness. ‘Why not?... It \n",
      "might easily happen,’ thought Rostov, ‘that the Emperor \n",
      "will meet me and give me an order as he would to any \n",
      "other officer; he’ll say: ‘G o and find out what’s there.’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "607 of 2882 \n",
      "There are many stories of his getting to know an officer in \n",
      "just such a chance way and attaching him to himself! \n",
      "What if he gave me a place near him? Oh, how I would \n",
      "guard him, how I would tell him the truth, how I would \n",
      "unmask his deceivers!’ And in order to realize vividly his \n",
      "love devotion to the sovereign, Rostov pictured to himself \n",
      "an enemy or a deceitful German, whom he would not only \n",
      "kill with pleasure but whom he would slap in the face \n",
      "before the Emperor. Suddenl y a distant shout aroused \n",
      "him. He started and opened his eyes. \n",
      "‘Where am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line... pass \n",
      "and watchword- shaft, Olmutz . What a nuisance that our \n",
      "squadron will be in reserve tomorrow,’ he thought. ‘I’ll \n",
      "ask leave to go to the front, this may be my only chance \n",
      "of seeing the Emperor. It won’t be long now before I am \n",
      "off duty. I’ll take another turn and when I get back I’ll go \n",
      "to the general and ask him.’ He readjusted himself in the \n",
      "saddle and touched up his horse  to ride once more round \n",
      "his hussars. It seemed to him that it was getting lighter. \n",
      "To the left he saw a sloping descent lit up, and facing it a \n",
      "black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall. On this knoll \n",
      "there was a white patch that Ro stov could not at all make \n",
      "out: was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon, or \n",
      "some unmelted snow, or some white houses? He even War and Peace  \n",
      "608 of 2882 \n",
      "thought something moved on that white spot. ‘I expect it’s \n",
      "snow... that spot... a spot- une tache,’ he thought. ‘There \n",
      "now... it’s not a tache... Natash a... sister, black eyes... \n",
      "Na... tasha... (Won’t she be surprised when I tell her how \n",
      "I’ve seen the Emperor?) Natasha... take my sabretache...’- \n",
      "‘Keep to the right, your honor, there are bushes here,’ \n",
      "came the voice of an hussar, past whom Rostov was \n",
      "riding in the act of falling asleep. Rostov lifted his head \n",
      "that had sunk almost to his horse’s mane and pulled up \n",
      "beside the hussar. He was succumbing to irresistible, \n",
      "youthful, childish drowsiness. ‘But what was I thinking? I \n",
      "mustn’t forget. How shall I speak to the Emperor? No, \n",
      "that’s not it- that’s tomorrow. Oh yes! Natasha... \n",
      "sabretache... saber them...Wh om? The hussars... Ah, the \n",
      "hussars with mustaches. Along the Tverskaya Street rode \n",
      "the hussar with mustaches... I thought about him too, just \n",
      "opposite Guryev’s house... Old Guryev.... Oh, but \n",
      "Denisov’s a fine fellow. But that’s all nonsense. The chief \n",
      "thing is that the Emperor is here. How he looked at me \n",
      "and wished to say something, but dared not.... No, it was I \n",
      "who dared not. But that’s nons ense, the chief thing is not \n",
      "to forget the important thing I was thinking of. Yes, Na-\n",
      "tasha, sabretache, oh, yes, yes! That’s right!’ And his \n",
      "head once more sank to his ho rse’s neck. All at once it \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "609 of 2882 \n",
      "seemed to him that he was being fired at. ‘What? What? \n",
      "What?... Cut them down! What?...’ said Rostov, waking \n",
      "up. At the moment he opened hi s eyes his eyes he heard \n",
      "in front of him, where th e enemy was, the long-drawn \n",
      "shouts of thousands of voices. His horse and the horse of \n",
      "the hussar near him pricked their ears at these shouts. \n",
      "Over there, where the shouting came from, a fire flared up \n",
      "and went out again, then another, and all along the French \n",
      "line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew \n",
      "louder and louder. Rostov could hear the sound of French \n",
      "words but could not distingui sh them. The din of many \n",
      "voices was too great; all he c ould hear was: ‘ahahah!’ and \n",
      "‘rrrr!’ \n",
      "‘What’s that? What do you make of it?’ said Rostov to \n",
      "the hussar beside him. ‘That must be the enemy’s camp!’ \n",

      "‘Why, don’t you hear it?’ Rostov asked again, after \n",
      "waiting for a reply. \n",

      "reluctantly. \n",

      "a general roar that only an army of several thousand men \n",
      "could produce. The lights sp read farther and farther, \n",
      "probably along the line of the French camp. Rostov no \n",
      "longer wanted to sleep. The gay triumphant shouting of \n",
      "the enemy army had a stimula ting effect on him. ‘Vive \n",
      "l’Empereur! L’Empereur!’ he now heard distinctly. \n",
      "‘They can’t be far off, probably just beyond the \n",
      "stream,’ he said to the hussar beside him. \n",
      "The hussar only sighed wit hout replying and coughed \n",
      "angrily. The sound of horse’s hoofs approaching at a trot \n",
      "along the line of hussars was heard, and out of the foggy \n",
      "darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars suddenly \n",
      "appeared, looming huge as an elephant. \n",
      "‘Your honor, the generals!’ said the sergeant, riding up \n",
      "to Rostov. \n",
      "Rostov, still looking round to ward the fires and the \n",

      "‘They were there this evening, but now I don’t know, \n",
      "your excellency. Shall I go with  some of my hussars to \n",

      "Rostov’s face in the mist. \n",
      "‘Well, go and see,’ he said, after a pause. \n",
      "‘Yes, sir.’ \n",
      "Rostov spurred his horse, called to Sergeant \n",
      "Fedchenko and two other hussars, told them to follow \n",
      "him, and trotted downhill in the direction from which the \n",
      "shouting came. He felt both fri ghtened and pleased to be War and Peace  \n",
      "612 of 2882 \n",
      "riding alone with three hussars  into that mysterious and \n",
      "dangerous misty distance where no one had been before \n",
      "him. Bagration called to him from the hill not to go \n",
      "beyond the stream, but Rostov pr etended not to hear him \n",
      "and did not stop but rode on and on, continually mistaking \n",
      "bushes for trees and gullies for men and continually \n",
      "discovering his mistakes. Havi ng descended the hill at a \n",
      "trot, he no longer saw either our own or the enemy’s fires, \n",
      "but heard the shouting of the French more loudly and \n",
      "distinctly. In the valley he saw before him something like \n",
      "a river, but when he reached it he found it was a road. \n",
      "Having come out onto the road  he reined in his horse, \n",
      "hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride over \n",
      "the black field up the hillside. To keep to the road which \n",
      "gleamed white in the mist w ould have been safer because \n",
      "it would be easier to see people coming along it. ‘Follow \n",
      "me!’ said he, crossed the road, and began riding up the \n",
      "hill at a gallop toward the point where the French pickets \n",
      "had been standing that evening. \n",
      "‘Your honor, there he is!’ cried one of the hussars \n",
      "behind him. And before Rostov had time to make out \n",
      "what the black thing was that  had suddenly appeared in \n",
      "the fog, there was a flash, followed by a report, and a \n",
      "bullet whizzing high up in the mi st with a plaintive sound \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "613 of 2882 \n",
      "passed out of hearing. Another musket missed fire but \n",
      "flashed in the pan. Rostov turned his horse and galloped \n",
      "back. Four more reports follo wed at intervals, and the \n",
      "bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in different \n",
      "tones. Rostov reined in his horse, whose spirits had risen, \n",
      "like his own, at the firing, and went back at a footpace. \n",
      "‘Well, some more! Some more!’ a merry voice was \n",
      "saying in his soul. But no more shots came. \n",
      "Only when approaching Ba gration did Rostov let his \n",
      "horse gallop again, and with his hand at the salute rode up \n",
      "to the general. \n",
      "Dolgorukov was still insisti ng that the French had \n",
      "retreated and had only lit fires to deceive us. \n",
      "‘What does that prove?’ he was saying as Rostov rode \n",
      "up. ‘They might retreat and leave the pickets.’ \n",
      "‘It’s plain that they have not all gone yet, Prince,’ said \n",

      "‘The picket is still on the hill, your excellency, just \n",

      "forward with his hand at the salute and unable to repress \n",
      "the smile of delight induced by his ride and especially by \n",
      "the sound of the bullets. War and Peace  \n",

      "which everything seems possible and everything \n",

      "When the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and \n",

      "glove from his shapely white hand, made a sign with it to \n",
      "the marshals, and ordered the action to begin. The \n",
      "marshals, accompanied by ad jutants, galloped off in \n",
      "different directions, and a few minutes later the chief \n",
      "forces of the French army moved rapidly toward those \n",

      "take the place of Prze byszewski’s and Langeron’s \n",
      "columns which had already gone down into the valley. He \n",
      "greeted the men of the foremo st regiment and gave them \n",
      "the order to march, thereby i ndicating that he intended to \n",
      "lead that column himself. When he had reached the \n",
      "village of Pratzen he halted. Prince Andrew was behind, \n",
      "among the immense number forming the commander in \n",

      "and irritation, though controlledly  calm as a man is at the \n",
      "approach of a long-awaite d moment. He was firmly \n",
      "convinced that this was the day of his Toulon, or his \n",
      "bridge of Arcola. How it would come about he did not \n",
      "know, but he felt sure it would do so. The locality and the \n",
      "position of our troops were know n to him as far as they \n",
      "could be known to anyone in  our army. His own strategic \n",
      "plan, which obviously could not  now be carried out, was \n",
      "forgotten. Now, entering into Weyrother’s plan, Prince \n",
      "Andrew considered possible contingencies and formed \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "627 of 2882 \n",
      "new projects such as might  call for his rapidity of \n",
      "perception and decision. \n",
      "To the left down below in the mist, the musketry fire \n",
      "of unseen forces could be heard. It was there Prince \n",
      "Andrew thought the fight woul d concentrate. ‘There we \n",

      "In the morning all that was left of the night mist on the \n",

      "visible in the valley to the left into which our troops had \n",
      "descended and from whence came the sounds of firing. \n",
      "Above the heights was the dark clear sky, and to the right \n",
      "the vast orb of the sun. In front, far off on the farther \n",
      "shore of that sea of mist , some wooded hills were \n",
      "discernible, and it was there the enemy probably was, for \n",
      "something could be descrie d. On the right the Guards \n",

      "disappeared in the sea of mist . In front and behind moved \n",
      "infantry. The commander in chief was standing at the end \n",
      "of the village letting the troops pass by him. That morning \n",
      "Kutuzov seemed worn and irritable. The infantry passing \n",

      "‘Do order them to form into battalion columns and go \n",

      "action. \n",
      "Kutuzov turned round without answering and his eye \n",
      "happened to fall upon Prince Andrew, who was beside \n",
      "him. Seeing him, Kutuzov’ s malevolent and caustic \n",
      "expression softened, as if admitting that what was being \n",
      "done was not his adjutant’s fa ult, and still not answering \n",
      "the Austrian adjutant, he addressed Bolkonski. \n",
      "‘Go, my dear fellow, and see whether the third division \n",

      "murmured to himself, still not replying to the Austrian. \n",
      "Prince Andrew galloped off to execute the order. \n",
      "Overtaking the battalions that continued to advance, he \n",
      "stopped the third division an d convinced himself that \n",
      "there really were no shar pshooters in front of our War and Peace  \n",
      "630 of 2882 \n",
      "columns. The colonel at the head of the regiment was \n",
      "much surprised at the comma nder in chief’s order to \n",
      "throw out skirmishers. He had felt perfectly sure that there \n",
      "were other troops in front of him and that the enemy must \n",
      "be at least six miles away. Th ere was really nothing to be \n",
      "seen in front except a barren descent hidden by dense \n",
      "mist. Having given orders in  the commander in chief’s \n",
      "name to rectify this omi ssion, Prince Andrew galloped \n",
      "back. Kutuzov still in the same place, his stout body \n",
      "resting heavily in the saddle w ith the lassitude of age, sat \n",
      "yawning wearily with closed  eyes. The troops were no \n",
      "longer moving, but stood with the butts of their muskets \n",
      "on the ground. \n",
      "‘All right, all right!’ he said to Prince Andrew, and \n",
      "turned to a general who, wa tch in hand, was saying it was \n",
      "time they started as all the left-flank columns had already \n",
      "descended. \n",
      "‘Plenty of time, your excellency,’ muttered Kutuzov in \n",
      "the midst of a yawn. ‘Plenty of time,’ he repeated. \n",
      "Just then at a distance behind Kutuzov was heard the \n",
      "sound of regiments saluting, and this sound rapidly came \n",
      "nearer along the whole exte nded line of the advancing \n",
      "Russian columns. Evidently the person they were greeting \n",
      "was riding quickly. When the so ldiers of the regiment in \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "631 of 2882 \n",
      "front of which Kutuzov was st anding began to shout, he \n",
      "rode a little to one side and looked round with a frown. \n",
      "Along the road from Pratzen ga lloped what looked like a \n",
      "squadron of horsemen in various uniforms. Two of them \n",
      "rode side by side in front, at full gallop. One in a black \n",
      "uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed \n",
      "chestnut horse, the other who was in a white uniform rode \n",
      "a black one. These were the two Emperors followed by \n",
      "their suites. Kutuzov, affec ting the manners of an old \n",
      "soldier at the front, gave the command ‘Attention!’ and \n",
      "rode up to the Emperors with a salute. His whole \n",
      "appearance and manner were suddenly transformed. He \n",
      "put on the air of a subordi nate who obeys without \n",
      "reasoning. With an affectation of respect which evidently \n",
      "struck Alexander unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted. \n",
      "This unpleasant impression merely flitted over the \n",
      "young and happy face of the Emperor like a cloud of haze \n",
      "across a clear sky and vanished. After his illness he \n",
      "looked rather thinner that day than on the field of Olmutz \n",
      "where Bolkonski had seen him for the first time abroad, \n",
      "but there was still the same  bewitching combination of \n",
      "majesty and mildness in his fine gray eyes, and on his \n",
      "delicate lips the same capacity for varying expression and War and Peace  \n",
      "632 of 2882 \n",
      "the same prevalent appear ance of goodhearted innocent \n",
      "youth. \n",
      "At the Olmutz review he had seemed more majestic; \n",
      "here he seemed brighter and more energetic. He was \n",
      "slightly flushed after gallopi ng two miles, and reining in \n",
      "his horse he sighed restfully and looked round at the faces \n",
      "of his suite, young and animated  as his own. Czartoryski, \n",
      "Novosiltsev, Prince Volkonsky, Strogonov, and the \n",
      "others, all richly dresse d gay young men on splendid, \n",
      "well-groomed, fresh, only slightly heated horses, \n",
      "exchanging remarks and smiling, had stopped behind the \n",
      "Emperor. The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long faced young \n",
      "man, sat very erect on his handsome black horse, looking \n",
      "about him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner. He \n",
      "beckoned to one of his white  adjutants and asked some \n",
      "question- ‘Most likely he is as king at what o’clock they \n",
      "started,’ thought Prince A ndrew, watching his old \n",
      "acquaintance with a smile he could not repress as he \n",
      "recalled his reception at Brunn. In the Emperors’ suite \n",
      "were the picked young orderly officers of the Guard and \n",
      "line regiments, Russian and Austrian. Among them were \n",

      "with embroidered cloths. \n",

      "633 of 2882 \n",
      "As when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from \n",

      "energy, and confidence of success reached Kutuzov’s \n",

      "brilliant young men. \n",
      "‘Why aren’t you beginning, Michael Ilarionovich?’ \n",

      "Francis. \n",
      "‘I am waiting, Your Majesty,’ answered Kutuzov, \n",
      "bending forward respectfully. \n",
      "The Emperor, frowning slightly, bent his ear forward \n",
      "as if he had not quite heard. \n",
      "‘Waiting, Your Majesty,’ re peated Kutuzov. (Prince \n",
      "Andrew noted that Kutu zov’s upper lip twitched \n",

      "join in at least to listen to what he was saying. But the \n",
      "Emperor Francis continued to  look about him and did not \n",
      "listen. \n",
      "‘That is just why I do not begin, sire,’ said Kutuzov in \n",

      "of not being heard, and agai n something in his face \n",
      "twitched- ‘That is just why I do not begin, sire, because \n",
      "we are not on parade and not on the Empress’ Field.’ said \n",
      "clearly and distinctly. \n",
      "In the Emperor’s suite all exchanged rapid looks that \n",
      "expressed dissatisfaction a nd reproach. ‘Old though he \n",
      "may be, he should not, he certa inly should not, speak like \n",
      "that,’ their glances seemed to say. \n",

      "anything more. But Kutuzov, with respectfully bowed \n",

      "about a minute. \n",
      "‘However, if you command it, Your Majesty,’ said \n",

      "speaking to an Austrian general. Prince Andrew, who was \n",
      "a little behind looking at them, turned to an adjutant to ask \n",
      "him for a field glass. \n",

      "638 of 2882 \n",
      "away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in \n",
      "front of us. \n",
      "‘It’s the enemy?... No!... Yes, see it is!... for certain.... \n",

      "of naive terror barely two steps from Prince Andrew \n",
      "shouted, ‘Brothers! All’s lost !’ And at this as if at a \n",

      "639 of 2882 \n",
      "an angry face, red and unlike himself, was shouting to \n",

      "‘So much the better! I shall see it close,’ he thought. \n",

      "At that moment, as the Horse Guards, having passed \n",

      "to gallop after them or to go where he was sent. This was \n",
      "the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that amazed the \n",

      "of all that mass of huge and handsome men, of all those \n",
      "brilliant, rich youths, offi cers and cadets, who had \n",

      "‘Why should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and \n",

      "away from them in his helm et and Horse Guards’ jacket, \n",

      "other side as eager as Boris.  ‘Count! I am wounded in my \n",

      "Having passed the Guards and traversed an empty \n",
      "space, Rostov, to avoid again getting in front of the first \n",

      "battle. ‘But be that what it may,’ he reflected, ‘there is no \n",
      "riding round it now. I must look for the commander in \n",

      "Imperial horses and Ilya Ivanych. I don’t think Ilya drives \n",

      "Rostov let go of the horse a nd was about to ride on, \n",
      "when a wounded officer passing by addressed him: \n",
      "‘Who is it you want?’ he as ked. ‘The commander in \n",
      "chief? He was killed by a cannon ball- struck in the breast \n",
      "before our regiment.’ \n",
      "‘Not killed- wounded!’ another officer corrected him. \n",
      "‘Who? Kutuzov?’ asked Rostov. War and Peace  \n",
      "656 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Not Kutuzov, but what’s his name- well, never mind... \n",
      "there are not many left alive. Go that way, to that village, \n",
      "all the commanders are there,’ said the officer, pointing to \n",
      "the village of Hosjeradek, and he walked on. \n",
      "Rostov rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to \n",
      "whom he was now going. The Emperor was wounded, the \n",
      "battle lost. It was impossible to doubt it now. Rostov rode \n",
      "in the direction pointed out to him, in which he saw \n",
      "turrets and a church. What n eed to hurry? What was he \n",
      "now to say to the Tsar or to Kutuzov, even if they were \n",
      "alive and unwounded? \n",
      "‘Take this road, your honor, that way you will be killed \n",
      "at once!’ a soldier shouted to him. ‘They’d kill you there!’ \n",
      "‘Oh, what are you talking about?’ said another. ‘Where \n",
      "is he to go? That way is nearer.’ \n",
      "Rostov considered, and then went in the direction \n",
      "where they said he would be killed. \n",
      "‘It’s all the same now. If the Emperor is wounded, am I \n",
      "to try to save myself?’ he  thought. He rode on to the \n",
      "region where the greatest numbe r of men had perished in \n",
      "fleeing from Pratzen. The French had not yet occupied \n",
      "that region, and the Russians- the uninjured and slightly \n",
      "wounded- had left it long a go. All about the field, like \n",
      "heaps of manure on well-kept plowland, lay from ten to \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "657 of 2882 \n",
      "fifteen dead and wounded to each couple of acres. The \n",
      "wounded crept together in twos  and threes and one could \n",
      "hear their distressing scr eams and groans, sometimes \n",
      "feigned- or so it seemed to  Rostov. He put his horse to a \n",
      "trot to avoid seeing all thes e suffering men, and he felt \n",
      "afraid- afraid not for his li fe, but for the courage he \n",
      "needed and which he knew w ould not stand the sight of \n",
      "these unfortunates. \n",
      "The French, who had ceased firing at this field strewn \n",
      "with dead and wounded where there was no one left to \n",
      "fire at, on seeing an adjuta nt riding over it trained a gun \n",
      "on him and fired several shots. The sensation of those \n",
      "terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around him \n",
      "merged in Rostov’s mind into a single feeling of terror \n",
      "and pity for himself. He remembered his mother’s last \n",
      "letter. ‘What would she feel,’ thought he, ‘if she saw me \n",
      "here now on this field with the cannon aimed at me?’ \n",
      "In the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops \n",
      "retiring from the field of battle, who though still in some \n",
      "confusion were less disordered. The French cannon did \n",
      "not reach there and the musketry fire sounded far away. \n",
      "Here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle was \n",
      "lost. No one whom Rostov asked could tell him where the \n",
      "Emperor or Kutuzov was. Some said the report that the War and Peace  \n",
      "658 of 2882 \n",
      "Emperor was wounded was correct, others that it was not, \n",
      "and explained the false rumor that had spread by the fact \n",
      "that the Emperor’s carriage had really galloped from the \n",
      "field of battle with the pale and terrified Ober-\n",
      "Hofmarschal Count Tolstoy, who had ridden out to the \n",
      "battlefield with others in the Emperor’s suite. One officer \n",
      "told Rostov that he had seen someone from headquarters \n",
      "behind the village to the left, and thither Rostov rode, not \n",
      "hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience. \n",
      "When he had ridden about two miles and had passed the \n",
      "last of the Russian troops, he  saw, near a kitchen garden \n",
      "with a ditch round it, two me n on horseback facing the \n",
      "ditch. One with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar \n",
      "to Rostov; the other on a beau tiful chestnut horse (which \n",
      "Rostov fancied he had seen be fore) rode up to the ditch, \n",
      "struck his horse with his s purs, and giving it the rein \n",
      "leaped lightly over. Only a little earth crumbled from the \n",
      "bank under the horse’s hind hoofs. Turning the horse \n",
      "sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially \n",
      "addressed the horseman with the white plumes, evidently \n",
      "suggesting that he should do the same. The rider, whose \n",
      "figure seemed familiar to Rostov and involuntarily riveted \n",
      "his attention, made a gesture of refusal with his head and \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "659 of 2882 \n",
      "hand and by that gesture Rost ov instantly recognized his \n",
      "lamented and adored monarch. \n",
      "‘But it can’t be he, alone in the midst of this empty \n",
      "field!’ thought Rostov. At that moment Alexander turned \n",
      "his head and Rostov saw the beloved features that were so \n",
      "deeply engraved on his memory. The Emperor was pale, \n",
      "his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow, but the charm, the \n",
      "mildness of his features, wa s all the greater. Rostov was \n",
      "happy in the assurance that the rumors about the Emperor \n",
      "being wounded were false. He was happy to be seeing \n",
      "him. He knew that he might and even ought to go straight \n",
      "to him and give the message Dolgorukov had ordered him \n",
      "to deliver. \n",
      "But as a youth in love trembles, is unnerved, and dares \n",
      "not utter the thoughts he has dreamed of for nights, but \n",
      "looks around for help or a chance of delay and flight \n",
      "when the longed-for moment comes and he is alone with \n",
      "her, so Rostov, now that he had attained what he had \n",
      "longed for more than anything else in the world, did not \n",
      "know how to approach the Emperor, and a thousand \n",
      "reasons occurred to him why it would be inconvenient, \n",
      "unseemly, and impossible to do so. \n",
      "‘What! It is as if I were glad of a chance to take \n",
      "advantage of his being alone  and despondent! A strange War and Peace  \n",
      "660 of 2882 \n",
      "face may seem unpleasant or painful to him at this \n",
      "moment of sorrow; besides, what can I say to him now, \n",
      "when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the \n",
      "mere sight of him?’ Not one of the innumerable speeches \n",
      "addressed to the Emperor that he had composed in his \n",
      "imagination could he now recall. Those speeches were \n",
      "intended for quite other conditions, they were for the most \n",
      "part to be spoken at a mome nt of victory and triumph, \n",
      "generally when he was dying of wounds and the \n",
      "sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds, and while \n",
      "dying he expressed the love his actions had proved. \n",
      "‘Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions \n",
      "for the right flank now that it is nearly four o’clock and \n",
      "the battle is lost? No, certainly  I must not approach him, I \n",
      "must not intrude on his refl ections. Better die a thousand \n",
      "times than risk receiving an unkind look or bad opinion \n",
      "from him,’ Rostov decided; and sorrowfully and with a \n",
      "heart full despair he rode aw ay, continually looking back \n",
      "at the Tsar, who still remained in the same attitude of \n",
      "indecision. \n",
      "While Rostov was thus arguing with himself and riding \n",
      "sadly away, Captain von Toll ch anced to ride to the same \n",
      "spot, and seeing the Emperor at once rode up to him, \n",
      "offered his services, and assisted him to cross the ditch on \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "661 of 2882 \n",
      "foot. The Emperor, wishing to rest and feeling unwell, sat \n",
      "down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside \n",
      "him. Rostov from a distance saw with envy and remorse \n",
      "how von Toll spoke long and warmly to the Emperor and \n",
      "how the Emperor, evidently weeping, covered his eyes \n",
      "with his hand and pressed von Toll’s hand. \n",
      "‘And I might have been in his place!’ thought Rostov, \n",
      "and hardly restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor, he \n",
      "rode on in utter despair, not knowing where to or why he \n",
      "was now riding. \n",
      "His despair was all the greater from feeling that his \n",
      "own weakness was the cause his grief. \n",
      "He might... not only might but  should, have gone up to \n",
      "the sovereign. It was a uni que chance to show his \n",
      "devotion to the Emperor and he had not made use of it.... \n",
      "‘What have I done?’ thought he. And he turned round and \n",
      "galloped back to the place where he had seen the \n",
      "Emperor, but there was no one beyond the ditch now. \n",
      "Only some carts and carriages  were passing by. From one \n",
      "of the drivers he learned that Kutuzov’s staff were not far \n",
      "off, in the village the ve hicles were going to. Rostov \n",
      "followed them. In front of him walked Kutuzov’s groom \n",
      "leading horses in horsecloths. Then came a cart, and War and Peace  \n",
      "662 of 2882 \n",
      "behind that walked an old, bandy-legged domestic serf in \n",
      "a peaked cap and sheepskin coat. \n",
      "‘Tit! I say, Tit!’ said the groom. \n",
      "‘What?’ answered the old man absent-mindedly. \n",
      "‘Go, Tit! Thresh a bit!’ \n",
      "‘Oh, you fool!’ said the old man, spitting angrily. \n",
      "Some time passed in silence, and then the same joke was \n",
      "repeated. \n",
      "Before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all \n",

      "hands of the French. \n",

      "In the rearguard, Dokhturov and others rallying some \n",

      "men looked at him and presse d to the bank, hesitating to \n",
      "step onto the ice. The ge neral on horseback at the \n",

      "wake up on the way to Moscow , but lay at the bottom of \n",

      "‘Denisov! We’re here! He’s asleep,’ he added, leaning \n",

      "Denisov gave no answer. \n",
      "‘There’s the corner at the crossroads, where the \n",

      "and still the same horse! And here’s the little shop where \n",

      "676 of 2882 \n",
      "we used to buy gingerbread! Can’t you hurry up? Now \n",

      "‘Which house is it?’ asked the driver. \n",
      "‘Why, that one, right at the end, the big one. Don’t you \n",
      "see? That’s our house,’ said Rostov. ‘Of course, it’s our \n",
      "house! Denisov, Denisov! We’re almost there!’ \n",
      "Denisov raised his head, coughed, and made no \n",
      "answer. \n",
      "‘Dmitri,’ said Rostov to his valet on the box, ‘those \n",

      "‘Yes, sir, and there’s a light in your father’s study.’ \n",

      "‘Come, get on! You shall have three rubles for vodka- get \n",
      "on!’ Rostov shouted, when the sleigh was only three \n",

      "not moving at all. At last the sleigh bore to the right, drew \n",
      "up at an entrance, and Rostov saw overhead the old \n",
      "familiar cornice with a bit of plaster broken off, the porch, \n",
      "and the post by the side of the pavement. He sprang out \n",
      "before the sleigh stopped, and ran into the hall. The house \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "677 of 2882 \n",
      "stood cold and silent, as if quite regardless of who had \n",
      "come to it. There was no one in the hall. ‘Oh God! Is \n",
      "everyone all right?’ he t hought, stopping for a moment \n",
      "with a sinking heart, and then immediately starting to run \n",
      "along the hall and up the warped steps of the familiar \n",
      "staircase. The well-known old door handle, which always \n",
      "angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned, \n",
      "turned as loosely as ever. A solitary tallow candle burned \n",
      "in the anteroom. \n",

      "and Prokofy, trembling with excitement, rushed toward \n",
      "the drawing-room door, proba bly in order to announce \n",
      "him, but, changing his mind, came back and stooped to \n",
      "kiss the young man’s shoulder. \n",

      "same: there were the same old card tables and the same \n",
      "chandelier with a cover over it; but someone had already \n",
      "seen the young master, and, before he had reached the \n",

      "Sonya too, all rosy red, cl ung to his arm and, radiant \n",
      "with bliss, looked eagerly toward his eyes, waiting for the \n",
      "look for which she longed. Sonya now was sixteen and \n",
      "she was very pretty, especia lly at this moment of happy, \n",
      "rapturous excitement. She gazed at him, not taking her \n",
      "eyes off him, and smiling and holding her breath. He gave \n",
      "her a grateful look, but was still expectant and looking for \n",
      "someone. The old countess had not yet come. But now \n",
      "steps were heard at the door, steps so rapid that they could \n",
      "hardly be his mother’s. \n",
      "Yet it was she, dressed in a new gown which he did not \n",
      "know, made since he had left. All the others let him go, \n",

      "wiped his eyes at the sight. \n",
      "‘Vasili Denisov, your s on’s friend,’ he said, \n",

      "confused. Denisov blushed too, but smiled and, taking \n",
      "Natasha’s hand, kissed it. \n",
      "Denisov was shown to the room prepared for him, and \n",

      "never taking their blissfully adoring eyes off him. His \n",
      "brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest to him \n",

      "681 of 2882 \n",
      "and disputed with one another who should bring him his \n",

      "Rostov was very happy in the love they showed him; \n",
      "but the first moment of meeti ng had been so beatific that \n",

      "something more, more and yet more. \n",
      "Next morning, after the fatigues of their journey, the \n",

      "In the room next their bedroom there was a confusion \n",
      "of sabers, satchels, sabretaches, open portmanteaus, and \n",
      "dirty boots. Two freshly cleaned  pairs with spurs had just \n",
      "been placed by the wall. The servants were bringing in \n",
      "jugs and basins, hot water for shaving, and their well-\n",

      "‘Why, is it late?’ \n",
      "‘Late! It’s nearly ten o’clock,’ answered Natasha’s \n",
      "voice. A rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering \n",
      "and laughter of girls’ voices came from the adjoining \n",
      "room. The door was opened a crack and there was a War and Peace  \n",
      "682 of 2882 \n",
      "glimpse of something blue, of ribbons, black hair, and \n",
      "merry faces. It was Natasha, Sonya, and Petya, who had \n",

      "unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed, opened \n",
      "the bedroom door. \n",
      "‘Is this your saber?’ he shouted. \n",

      "were both fresh, rosy, and br ight. Sonya ran away, but \n",
      "Natasha, taking her brother’s arm, led him into the sitting \n",

      "another time to ask questions and give replies concerning \n",
      "a thousand little matters whic h could not interest anyone \n",
      "but themselves. Natasha laughed at every word he said or \n",
      "that she said herself, not b ecause what they were saying \n",
      "was amusing, but because she felt happy and was unable \n",
      "to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter. \n",
      "‘Oh, how nice, how splendid!’ she said to everything. \n",
      "Rostov felt that, under the influence of the warm rays \n",
      "of love, that childlike smile  which had not once appeared \n",
      "on his face since he left home  now for the first time after \n",
      "eighteen months again brightened his soul and his face. \n",
      "‘No, but listen,’ she said, ‘now you are quite a man, \n",
      "aren’t you? I’m awfully glad you’re my brother.’ She \n",
      "touched his mustache. ‘I want to know what you men are \n",
      "like. Are you the same as we? No?’ \n",
      "‘Why did Sonya run away?’ asked Rostov. \n",
      "‘Ah, yes! That’s a whole long story! How are you \n",
      "going to speak to her- thou or you?’ War and Peace  \n",
      "684 of 2882 \n",

      "‘No, call her you, please! I’ll tell you all about it some \n",
      "other time. No, I’ll tell you now. You know Sonya’s my \n",

      "She pulled up her muslin sl eeve and showed him a red \n",
      "scar on her long, slender, de licate arm, high above the \n",
      "elbow on that part that is covered even by a ball dress. \n",
      "‘I burned this to prove my love  for her. I just heated a \n",

      "Sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms, \n",
      "in what used to be his ol d schoolroom, and looking into \n",

      "of home and childhood which had no meaning for anyone \n",

      "the burning of an arm with a ru ler as a proof of love did \n",
      "not seem to him senseless, he understood and was not \n",

      "‘No, no!’ cried Natasha, ‘she and I have already talked \n",

      "you see, if you say that- if you consider yourself bound by \n",
      "your promise- it will seem as if she had not meant it \n",

      "you must, and that wouldn’t do at all.’ \n",
      "Rostov saw that it had been well considered by them. \n",
      "Sonya had already struck him by her beauty on the \n",
      "preceding day. Today, when he had caught a glimpse of \n",
      "her, she seemed still more lovely. She was a charming girl \n",

      "686 of 2882 \n",
      "now, and even marry her, Rostov thought, but just now \n",
      "there were so many other plea sures and interests before \n",
      "him! ‘Yes, they have taken a wise decision,’ he thought, \n",
      "‘I must remain free.’ \n",
      "‘Well then, that’s excellent,’ said he. ‘We’ll talk it over \n",
      "later on. Oh, how glad I am to have you! \n",
      "‘Well, and are you still true to Boris?’ he continued. \n",
      "‘Oh, what nonsense!’ cried Natasha, laughing. ‘I don’t \n",
      "think about him or anyone else, and I don’t want anything \n",
      "of the kind.’ \n",
      "‘Dear me! Then what are you up now?’ \n",
      "‘Now?’ repeated Natasha, and a happy smile lit up her \n",

      "‘No.’ \n",
      "‘Not seen Duport- the famous dancer? Well then, you \n",
      "won’t understand. That’s what I’m up to.’ \n",
      "Curving her arms, Natasha held out her skirts as \n",
      "dancers do, ran back a few steps, turned, cut a caper, \n",
      "brought her little feet sharply together, and made some \n",
      "steps on the very tips of her toes. \n",
      "‘See, I’m standing! See!’ she said, but could not \n",
      "maintain herself on her toes any longer. ‘So that’s what \n",
      "I’m up to! I’ll never marry anyone, but will be a dancer. \n",
      "Only don’t tell anyone.’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "687 of 2882 \n",
      "Rostov laughed so loud and merrily that Denisov, in \n",
      "his bedroom, felt envious a nd Natasha could not help \n",
      "joining in. \n",
      "‘No, but don’t you think it’s nice?’ she kept repeating. \n",
      "‘Nice! And so you no longer wish to marry Boris?’ \n",
      "Natasha flared up. ‘I don’t want to marry anyone. And \n",
      "I’ll tell him so when I see him!’ \n",
      "‘Dear me!’ said Rostov. \n",
      "‘But that’s all rubbish,’ Natasha chattered on. ‘And is \n",
      "Denisov nice?’ she asked. \n",
      "‘Yes, indeed!’ \n",
      "‘Oh, well then, good-by: go and dress. Is he very \n",
      "terrible, Denisov?’ \n",
      "‘Why terrible?’ asked Nicholas. ‘No, Vaska is a \n",
      "splendid fellow.’ \n",
      "‘You call him Vaska? That’s funny! And is he very \n",

      "And Natasha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe, \n",
      "like a ballet dancer, but smiling as only happy girls of \n",
      "fifteen can smile. When Rostov met Sonya in the drawing \n",
      "room, he reddened. He did not  know how to behave with \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "688 of 2882 \n",
      "her. The evening before, in the first happy moment of \n",
      "meeting, they had kissed each other, but today they felt it \n",
      "could not be done; he felt that everybody, including his \n",
      "mother and sisters, was l ooking inquiringly at him and \n",
      "watching to see how he would behave with her. He kissed \n",
      "her hand and addressed her not as thou but as you- Sonya. \n",
      "But their eyes met and said  thou, and exchanged tender \n",
      "kisses. Her looks asked him to forgive her for having \n",
      "dared, by Natasha’s intermediacy, to remind him of his \n",
      "promise, and then thanked him for his love. His looks \n",
      "thanked her for offering him his freedom and told her that \n",
      "one way or another he would never cease to love her, for \n",
      "that would be impossible. \n",
      "‘How strange it is,’ said Vera, selecting a moment \n",
      "when all were silent, ‘that Sonya and Nicholas now say \n",
      "you to one another and meet like strangers.’ \n",
      "Vera’s remark was correct, as her remarks always \n",
      "were, but, like most of her observations, it made everyone \n",

      "Natasha, but even the old c ountess, who- dreading this \n",
      "love affair which might hi nder Nicholas from making a \n",
      "brilliant match- blushed like a girl. \n",
      "Denisov, to Rostov’s surprise, appeared in the drawing \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "689 of 2882 \n",
      "uniform, looking just as smart as he made himself when \n",
      "going into battle, and he was more amiable to the ladies \n",

      "690 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter II \n",
      "On his return to Moscow from the army, Nicholas \n",
      "Rostov was welcomed by his home circle as the best of \n",
      "sons, a hero, and their darli ng Nikolenka; by his relations \n",
      "as a charming, attractive, and polite young man; by his \n",
      "acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars, a good \n",
      "dancer, and one of the best matches in the city. \n",
      "The Rostovs knew everybody in Moscow. The old \n",
      "count had money enough that year, as all his estates had \n",
      "been remortgaged, and so Nicholas, acquiring a trotter of \n",
      "his own, very stylish riding breeches of the latest cut, such \n",
      "as no one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of the latest \n",
      "fashion, with extremely pointed toes and small silver \n",
      "spurs, passed his time very gaily. After a short period of \n",
      "adapting himself to the old c onditions of life, Nicholas \n",
      "found it very pleasant to be at home again. He felt that he \n",
      "had grown up and matured ve ry much. His despair at \n",
      "failing in a Scripture exam ination, his borrowing money \n",
      "from Gavril to pay a sleigh dr iver, his kissing Sonya on \n",
      "the sly- he now recalled all this as childishness he had left \n",
      "immeasurably behind. Now he was a lieutenant of \n",

      "action, and in the company of well-known, elderly, and \n",
      "respected racing men was traini ng a trotter of his own for \n",
      "a race. He knew a lady on one of the boulevards whom he \n",
      "visited of an evening. He led the mazurka at the \n",
      "Arkharovs’ ball, talked about the war with Field Marshal \n",
      "Kamenski, visited the English Club, and was on intimate \n",
      "terms with a colonel of forty to whom Denisov had \n",
      "introduced \n",
      "His passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in \n",
      "Moscow. But still, as he did not see him and had no \n",
      "opportunity of seeing him, he often spoke about him and \n",
      "about his love for him, letting it be understood that he had \n",
      "not told all and that there wa s something in his feelings \n",
      "for the Emperor not everyone could understand, and with \n",
      "his whole soul he shared the adoration then common in \n",

      "During Rostov’s short stay in Moscow, before \n",
      "rejoining the army, he did not  draw closer to Sonya, but \n",
      "rather drifted away from he r. She was very pretty and \n",
      "sweet, and evidently deeply in love with him, but he was \n",
      "at the period of youth when there seems so much to do \n",
      "that there is no time for that sort of thing and a young man War and Peace  \n",
      "692 of 2882 \n",
      "fears to bind himself and pr izes his freedom which he \n",
      "needs for so many other things. When he thought of \n",

      "‘Ah, there will be, and there are, many more such girls \n",
      "somewhere whom I do not yet know. There will be time \n",
      "enough to think about love wh en I want to, but now I \n",
      "have no time.’ Besides, it seemed to him that the society \n",
      "of women was rather derogatory to his manhood. He went \n",
      "to balls and into ladies’ society with an affectation of \n",
      "doing so against his will. The races, the English Club, \n",
      "sprees with Denisov, and visits  to a certain house- that \n",
      "was another matter and quite the thing for a dashing \n",
      "young hussar! \n",
      "At the beginning of March, old Count Ilya Rostov was \n",
      "very busy arranging a dinner in honor of Prince Bagration \n",

      "cucumbers, strawberries, veal, and fish for this dinner. \n",
      "The count had been a member and on the committee of \n",

      "693 of 2882 \n",

      "men would be so well able a nd willing to make up out of \n",
      "their own resources what might be needed for the success \n",

      "under no other management could they so easily extract a \n",

      "‘Well then, mind and have cocks’ comb in the turtle \n",
      "soup, you know!’ \n",
      "‘Shall we have three cold dishes then?’ asked the cook. \n",
      "The count considered. \n",
      "‘We can’t have less- yes, three... the mayonnaise, \n",
      "that’s one,’ said he, bending down a finger. \n",

      "dear me! I was forgetting. We must have another entree. \n",
      "Ah, goodness gracious!’ he clutched at his head. ‘Who is \n",
      "going to get me the flowers? Dmitri! Eh, Dmitri! Gallop \n",
      "off to our Moscow estate,’ he  said to the factotum who \n",
      "appeared at his call. ‘Hurry  off and tell Maksim, the \n",
      "gardener, to set the serfs to work. Say that everything out War and Peace  \n",

      "Having given several more orders, he was about to go \n",

      "something else of importance, he returned again, called \n",
      "back the cook and the club steward, and again began \n",
      "giving orders. A light footstep  and the clinking of spurs \n",
      "were heard at the door, a nd the young count, handsome, \n",
      "rosy, with a dark little must ache, evidently rested and \n",

      "a good dinner, but providing it and serving it all up, that’s \n",
      "not their business! \n",
      "‘That’s it, that’s it!’ exclaimed the count, and gaily \n",
      "seizing his son by both hands , he cried, ‘Now I’ve got \n",
      "you, so take the sleigh and pair at once, and go to \n",
      "Bezukhob’s, and tell him ‘Count Ilya has sent you to ask \n",

      "‘And am I to bring the gyps y girls along with him?’ \n",

      "698 of 2882 \n",

      "unheard-of, and impossible ev ent of a Russian defeat, \n",

      "where he alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and \n",
      "had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as \n",

      "were Denisov, Rostov, a nd Dolokhov- who was now \n",

      "approached respectfully to hear the voices of well-known \n",
      "men. The largest circles formed round Count Rostopchin, \n",

      "his shoulder, as when Rostov had seen him on the eve of \n",
      "the battle of Austerlitz, but wore a tight new uniform with \n",

      "naively festive in his air, which, in conjunction with his \n",
      "firm and virile features, gave him a rather comical \n",
      "expression. Bekleshev and Theodore Uvarov, who had \n",
      "arrived with him, paused at the doorway to allow him, as \n",
      "the guest of honor, to ente r first. Bagration was \n",
      "embarrassed, not wishing to avail himself of their \n",
      "courtesy, and this caused some delay at the doors, but \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "705 of 2882 \n",
      "after all he did at last enter first. He walked shyly and \n",
      "awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room, \n",
      "not knowing what to do with  his hands; he was more \n",
      "accustomed to walk over a plowed field under fire, as he \n",
      "had done at the head of the Kursk regiment at Schon \n",
      "Grabern- and he would have found that easier. The \n",
      "committeemen met him at the first door and, expressing \n",
      "their delight at seeing such a highly honored guest, took \n",
      "possession of him as it we re, without waiting for his \n",
      "reply, surrounded him, and led him to the drawing room. \n",
      "It was at first impossible to enter the drawing-room door \n",
      "for the crowd of members and guests jostling one another \n",
      "and trying to get a good look at Bagration over each \n",
      "other’s shoulders, as if he were some rare animal. Count \n",
      "Ilya Rostov, laughing and repeating the words, ‘Make \n",
      "way, dear boy! Make way, make way!’ pushed through \n",
      "the crowd more energetically than anyone, led the guests \n",
      "into the drawing room, and seated them on the center \n",
      "sofa. The bigwigs, the most respected members of the \n",
      "Club, beset the new arrivals. Count Ilya, again thrusting \n",
      "his way through the crowd, went out of the drawing room \n",
      "and reappeared a minute later with another \n",
      "committeeman, carrying a large silver salver which he \n",
      "presented to Prince Bagrati on. On the salver lay some War and Peace  \n",
      "706 of 2882 \n",
      "verses composed and printed in the hero’s honor. \n",
      "Bagration, on seeing the salver, glanced around in \n",
      "dismay, as though seeking help. But all eyes demanded \n",
      "that he should submit. Feeli ng himself in their power, he \n",
      "resolutely took the salver with both hands and looked \n",
      "sternly and reproachfully at the count who had presented \n",
      "it to him. Someone obligingly took the dish from \n",
      "Bagration (or he would, it seemed, have held it till \n",
      "evening and have gone in to dinner with it) and drew his \n",
      "attention to the verses. \n",
      "‘Well, I will read them, then!’ Bagration seemed to \n",
      "say, and, fixing his weary eyes on the paper, began to read \n",
      "them with a fixed and serious  expression. But the author \n",
      "himself took the verses and began reading them aloud. \n",
      "Bagration bowed his bead and listened: \n",
      "Bring glory then to Alexander’s reign \n",
      "And on the throne our Titus shield. \n",
      "A dreaded foe be thou, kindhearted as a man, \n",
      "A Rhipheus at home, a Caesar in the field! \n",
      "E’en fortunate Napoleon \n",
      "Knows by experience, now, Bagration, \n",
      "And dare not Herculean Russians trouble... \n",
      "But before he had finished reading, a stentorian major-\n",
      "domo announced that dinner was ready! The door opened, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "707 of 2882 \n",
      "and from the dining room came  the resounding strains of \n",
      "the polonaise: \n",
      "Conquest’s joyful thunder waken, \n",
      "Triumph, valiant Russians, now!... \n",
      "and Count Rostov, glancing angrily at the author who \n",
      "went on reading his verses, bowed to Bagration. Everyone \n",
      "rose, feeling that dinner was more important than verses, \n",
      "and Bagration, again preceding all the rest, went in to \n",
      "dinner. He was seated in the place of honor between two \n",
      "Alexanders- Bekleshev and Naryshkin- which was a \n",
      "significant allusion to the na me of the sovereign. Three \n",
      "hundred persons took their se ats in the dining room, \n",
      "according to their rank and importance: the more \n",
      "important nearer to the honored  guest, as naturally as \n",
      "water flows deepest where the land lies lowest. \n",
      "Just before dinner, Count Ilya Rostov presented his son \n",
      "to Bagration, who recognized him and said a few words to \n",
      "him, disjointed and awkward, as were all the words he \n",
      "spoke that day, and Count Ilya looked joyfully and \n",
      "proudly around while Bagration spoke to his son. \n",
      "Nicholas Rostov, with Denisov and his new \n",
      "acquaintance, Dolokhov, sat almost at the middle of the \n",
      "table. Facing them sat Pierre, beside Prince Nesvitski. \n",
      "Count Ilya Rostov with the other members of the War and Peace  \n",
      "708 of 2882 \n",
      "committee sat facing Bagration and, as the very \n",
      "personification of Moscow hos pitality, did the honors to \n",
      "the prince. \n",
      "His efforts had not been in vain. The dinner, both the \n",
      "Lenten and the other fare, wa s splendid, yet he could not \n",
      "feel quite at ease till the end of the meal. He winked at the \n",
      "butler, whispered directions to the footmen, and awaited \n",
      "each expected dish with some anxiety. Everything was \n",
      "excellent. With the second cour se, a gigantic  sterlet (at \n",
      "sight of which Ilya Rostov blushed with self-conscious \n",
      "pleasure), the footmen bega n popping corks and filling \n",
      "the champagne glasses. After the fish, which made a \n",
      "certain sensation, the count exchanged glances with the \n",
      "other committeemen. ‘There will be many toasts, it’s time \n",
      "to begin,’ he whispered, and taking up his glass, he rose. \n",
      "All were silent, waiting for what he would say. \n",
      "‘To the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!’ he \n",
      "cried, and at the same moment his kindly eyes grew moist \n",
      "with tears of joy and enthusiasm. The band immediately \n",
      "struck up ‘Conquest’s joyful thunder waken...’ All rose \n",
      "and cried ‘Hurrah!’ Bagration also rose and shouted \n",
      "‘Hurrah!’ in exactly the same voice in which he had \n",
      "shouted it on the field at  Schon Grabern. Young Rostov’s \n",
      "ecstatic voice could be h eard above the three hundred \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "709 of 2882 \n",
      "others. He nearly wept. ‘To th e health of our Sovereign, \n",
      "the Emperor!’ he roared, ‘Hurrah!’ and emptying his glass \n",
      "at one gulp he dashed it to the floor. Many followed his \n",
      "example, and the loud shouting continued for a long time. \n",
      "When the voices subsided, the footmen cleared away the \n",
      "broken glass and everybody sat down again, smiling at the \n",
      "noise they had made and exchanging remarks. The old \n",
      "count rose once more, glanced at a note lying beside his \n",
      "plate, and proposed a toast, ‘T o the health of the hero of \n",
      "our last campaign, Prince Peter Ivanovich Bagration!’ and \n",
      "again his blue eyes grew mois t. ‘Hurrah!’ cried the three \n",
      "hundred voices again, but instead of the band a choir \n",
      "began singing a cantata composed by Paul Ivanovich \n",
      "Kutuzov: \n",
      "Russians! O’er all barriers on! \n",
      "Courage conquest guarantees; \n",
      "Have we not Bagration? \n",
      "He brings foe men to their knees,... etc. \n",
      "As soon as the singing was over, another and another \n",
      "toast was proposed and Count Ilya Rostov became more \n",
      "and more moved, more glass was smashed, and the \n",
      "shouting grew louder. They drank to Bekleshev, \n",
      "Naryshkin, Uvarov, Dolgorukov, Apraksin, Valuev, to the \n",
      "committee, to all the Club members and to all the Club War and Peace  \n",
      "710 of 2882 \n",
      "guests, and finally to Count Ilya Rostov separately, as the \n",
      "organizer of the banquet. At that toast, the count took out \n",
      "his handkerchief and, covering his face, wept outright. \n",

      "Chapter IV \n",
      "Pierre sat opposite Dolokhov and Nicholas Rostov. As \n",
      "usual, he ate and drank much, and eagerly. But those who \n",
      "knew him intimately noticed th at some great change had \n",
      "come over him that day. He was silent all through dinner \n",
      "and looked about, blinking and scowling, or, with fixed \n",
      "eyes and a look of complete absent-mindedness, kept \n",
      "rubbing the bridge of his nose. His face was depressed \n",
      "and gloomy. He seemed to se e and hear nothing of what \n",
      "was going on around him and to be absorbed by some \n",
      "depressing and unsolved problem. \n",
      "The unsolved problem that tormented him was caused \n",
      "by hints given by the princess,  his cousin, at Moscow, \n",
      "concerning Dolokhov’s intimacy with his wife, and by an \n",
      "anonymous letter he had received that morning, which in \n",
      "the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said \n",
      "that he saw badly through his spectacles, but that his \n",
      "wife’s connection with Dol okhov was a secret to no one \n",
      "but himself. Pierre absolu tely disbelieved both the \n",
      "princess’ hints and the letter, but he feared now to look at \n",
      "Dolokhov, who was sitting opposite him. Every time he \n",
      "chanced to meet Dolokhov’s handsome insolent eyes, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "712 of 2882 \n",
      "Pierre felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his \n",
      "soul and turned quickly awa y. Involuntarily recalling his \n",
      "wife’s past and her relati ons with Dolokhov, Pierre saw \n",
      "clearly that what was said in the letter might be true, or \n",
      "might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his \n",
      "wife. He involuntarily reme mbered how Dolokhov, who \n",
      "had fully recovered his former position after the \n",
      "campaign, had returned to Petersburg and come to him. \n",
      "Availing himself of his friendly relations with Pierre as a \n",
      "boon companion, Dolokhov had come straight to his \n",
      "house, and Pierre had put him up and lent him money. \n",
      "Pierre recalled how Helene  had smilingly expressed \n",
      "disapproval of Dolokhov’s living at their house, and how \n",
      "cynically Dolokhov had praised his wife’s beauty to him \n",
      "and from that time till they came to Moscow had not left \n",
      "them for a day. \n",
      "‘Yes, he is very handsome,’ thought Pierre, ‘and I \n",
      "know him. It would be partic ularly pleasant to him to \n",
      "dishonor my name and ridicule me, just because I have \n",
      "exerted myself on his behalf, befriended him, and helped \n",
      "him. I know and understand what a spice that would add \n",
      "to the pleasure of deceiving me, if it really were true. Yes, \n",
      "if it were true, but I do not be lieve it. I have no right to, \n",
      "and can’t, believe it.’ He remembered the expression \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "713 of 2882 \n",
      "Dolokhov’s face assumed in his moments of cruelty, as \n",
      "when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them \n",
      "into the water, or when he challenged a man to a duel \n",
      "without any reason, or shot  a post-boy’s horse with a \n",
      "pistol. That expression was often on Dolokhov’s face \n",
      "when looking at him. ‘Yes, he  is a bully,’ thought Pierre, \n",
      "‘to kill a man means nothing to him. It must seem to him \n",
      "that everyone is afraid of him, and that must please him. \n",
      "He must think that I, too, am afraid of him- and in fact I \n",
      "am afraid of him,’ he thought, and again he felt something \n",
      "terrible and monstrous rising in his soul. Dolokhov, \n",
      "Denisov, and Rostov were now sitting opposite Pierre and \n",
      "seemed very gay. Rostov was talking merrily to his two \n",
      "friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a \n",
      "notorious duelist and rake, and every now and then he \n",
      "glanced ironically at Pierre, whose preoccupied, absent-\n",
      "minded, and massive figure was a very noticeable one at \n",
      "the dinner. Rostov looked inim ically at Pierre, first \n",
      "because Pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich \n",
      "civilian, the husband of a beauty, and in a word- an old \n",
      "woman; and secondly because Pierre in his preoccupation \n",
      "and absent-mindedness had not recognized Rostov and \n",
      "had not responded to his gr eeting. When the Emperor’s War and Peace  \n",
      "714 of 2882 \n",
      "health was drunk, Pierre, lost in thought, did not rise or \n",
      "lift his glass. \n",
      "‘What are you about?’ shouted Rostov, looking at him \n",
      "in an ecstasy of exasperation. ‘Don’t you hear it’s His \n",
      "Majesty the Emperor’s health?’ \n",
      "Pierre sighed, rose submi ssively, emptied his glass, \n",
      "and, waiting till all were seated again, turned with his \n",
      "kindly smile to Rostov. \n",
      "‘Why, I didn’t recognize you!’ he said. But Rostov was \n",
      "otherwise engaged; he was shouting ‘Hurrah!’ \n",
      "‘Why don’t you renew the acquaintance?’ said \n",
      "Dolokhov to Rostov. \n",
      "‘Confound him, he’s a fool!’ said Rostov. \n",
      "‘One should make up to th e husbands of pretty \n",
      "women,’ said Denisov. \n",
      "Pierre did not catch what they were saying, but knew \n",
      "they were talking about hi m. He reddened and turned \n",
      "away. \n",
      "‘Well, now to the health of handsome women!’ said \n",
      "Dolokhov, and with a serious expression, but with a smile \n",
      "lurking at the corners of hi s mouth, he turned with his \n",
      "glass to Pierre. \n",
      "‘Here’s to the health of lovely women, Peterkin- and \n",
      "their lovers!’ he added. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "715 of 2882 \n",
      "Pierre, with downcast eyes , drank out of his glass \n",
      "without looking at Dolokhov or answering him. The \n",
      "footman, who was distributing leaflets with Kutuzov’s \n",
      "cantata, laid one before Pie rre as one of the principal \n",
      "guests. He was just going to take it when Dolokhov, \n",
      "leaning across, snatched it from his hand and began \n",
      "reading it. Pierre looked at Dolokhov and his eyes \n",
      "dropped, the something terrible and monstrous that had \n",
      "tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of \n",
      "him. He leaned his whole massive body across the table. \n",
      "‘How dare you take it?’ he shouted. \n",
      "Hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed, \n",
      "Nesvitski and the neighbor on his right quickly turned in \n",
      "alarm to Bezukhov. \n",
      "‘Don’t! Don’t! What are you about?’ whispered their \n",
      "frightened voices. \n",
      "Dolokhov looked at Pierre with clear, mirthful, cruel \n",
      "eyes, and that smile of his which seemed to say, ‘Ah! This \n",
      "is what I like!’ \n",
      "‘You shan’t have it!’ he said distinctly. \n",
      "Pale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy. \n",
      "‘You...! you... scoundrel! I challenge you!’ he \n",
      "ejaculated, and, pushing back his chair, he rose from the \n",
      "table. War and Peace  \n",
      "716 of 2882 \n",
      "At the very instant he did th is and uttered those words, \n",
      "Pierre felt that the question of  his wife’s guilt which had \n",

      "yellow. He had evidently not slept that night. He looked \n",
      "about distractedly and screwed up his eyes as if dazzled \n",
      "by the sun. He was entirely absorbed by two \n",

      "‘So I can fire when I like!’ said Pierre, and at the word \n",

      "721 of 2882 \n",
      "right hand at arm’s length, a pparently afraid of shooting \n",

      "Pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone. Both in \n",

      "suddenly arose within him that  he could not fall asleep, \n",

      "And why? How did I come to do it?’- ‘Because you \n",

      "774 of 2882 \n",
      "Nicholas that this was all he could let him have till May, \n",

      "not only the loss of sixt een hundred rubles, but the \n",
      "necessity of going back on his word. With a sinking heart \n",
      "he watched Dolokhov’s hands  and thought, ‘Now then, \n",

      "rose before him with such vividness, clearness, and charm \n",

      "figures scored against him, which he had reckoned up to \n",
      "ten thousand, but that now, as he vaguely supposed, must \n",
      "have risen to fifteen thous and. In reality it already \n",
      "exceeded twenty thousand rubles. Dolokhov was no \n",
      "longer listening to stories or  telling them, but followed \n",
      "every movement of Rostov’s hands and occasionally ran \n",
      "his eyes over the score against him. He had decided to \n",
      "play until that score reache d forty-three thousand. He had \n",
      "fixed on that number because forty-three was the sum of \n",
      "his and Sonya’s joint ages. Ro stov, leaning his head on \n",
      "both hands, sat at the table wh ich was scrawled over with \n",
      "figures, wet with spilled wi ne, and littered with cards. \n",
      "One tormenting impression did not leave him: that those \n",

      "and took a card with that num ber and tried staking the \n",
      "total of his losses on it, then he looked round for aid from \n",
      "the other players, or peered at the now cold face of \n",
      "Dolokhov and tried to read what was passing in his mind. \n",
      "‘He knows of course what th is loss means to me. He \n",
      "can’t want my ruin. Wasn’t he my friend? Wasn’t I fond \n",

      "anyone, or insulted or wished harm to anyone? Why such \n",
      "a terrible misfortune? And when did it begin? Such a little \n",
      "while ago I came to this table with the thought of winning \n",
      "a hundred rubles to buy that casket for Mamma’s name \n",

      "778 of 2882 \n",
      "lighthearted! And I did not  realize how happy I was! \n",
      "When did that end and when did this new, terrible state of \n",
      "things begin? What marked the change? I sat all the time \n",
      "in this same place at this table, chose and placed cards, \n",
      "and watched those broad-boned agile hands in the same \n",
      "way. When did it happen and what has happened? I am \n",
      "well and strong and still the same and in the same place. \n",
      "No, it can’t be! Surely it will all end in nothing!’ \n",
      "He was flushed and bathed in perspiration, though the \n",
      "room was not hot. His face was terrible and piteous to see, \n",
      "especially from its helpless efforts to seem calm. \n",
      "The score against him reached the fateful sum of forty-\n",
      "three thousand. Rostov had ju st prepared a card, by \n",
      "bending the corner of which he meant to double the three \n",
      "thousand just put down to his score, when Dolokhov, \n",
      "slamming down the pack of cards, put it aside and began \n",
      "rapidly adding up the total of Rostov’s debt, breaking the \n",
      "chalk as he marked the figures in his clear, bold hand. \n",
      "‘Supper, it’s time for supper! And here are the \n",

      "779 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Well, won’t you go on? I had a splendid card all \n",

      "him most. \n",
      "‘It’s all up! I’m lost!’ thought he. ‘Now a bullet \n",
      "through my brain- that’s all th at’s left me! ‘ And at the \n",
      "same time he said in a cheerful voice: \n",
      "‘Come now, just this one more little card!’ \n",
      "‘All right!’ said Dolokhov, having finished the \n",
      "addition. ‘All right! Twenty-one rubles,’ he said, pointing \n",
      "to the figure twenty-one by which the total exceeded the \n",
      "round sum of forty-three thous and; and taking up a pack \n",
      "he prepared to deal. Rost ov submissively unbent the \n",
      "corner of his card and, instead of the six thousand he had \n",
      "intended, carefully wrote twenty-one. \n",
      "‘It’s all the same to me,’ he said. ‘I only want to see \n",
      "whether you will let me win this ten, or beat it.’ \n",
      "Dolokhov began to deal se riously. Oh, how Rostov \n",
      "detested at that moment those hands with their short \n",
      "reddish fingers and hairy wrists, which held him in their \n",
      "power.... The ten fell to him. \n",
      "‘You owe forty-three thousand, Count,’ said \n",
      "Dolokhov, and stretching himself he rose from the table. \n",
      "‘One does get tired sitting so long,’ he added. \n",
      "‘Yes, I’m tired too,’ said Rostov. War and Peace  \n",
      "780 of 2882 \n",
      "Dolokhov cut him short, as if to remind him that it was \n",
      "not for him to jest. \n",
      "‘When am I to receive the money, Count?’ \n",
      "Rostov, flushing, drew Dolokhov into the next room. \n",
      "‘I cannot pay it all immediat ely. Will you take an \n",
      "I.O.U.?’ he said. \n",
      "‘I say, Rostov,’ said Dolokhov clearly, smiling and \n",
      "looking Nicholas straight in the eyes, ‘you know the \n",
      "saying, ‘Lucky in love, unlucky at  cards.’ Your cousin is \n",
      "in love with you, I know.’ \n",
      "‘Oh, it’s terrible to feel oneself so in this man’s \n",

      "inflict on his father and mother by the news of this loss, \n",
      "he knew what a relief it would be to escape it all, and felt \n",
      "that Dolokhov knew that he c ould save him from all this \n",

      "At home, they had not yet gone to bed. The young \n",

      "countess, waiting for the retu rn of her husband and son, \n",
      "sat playing patience with th e old gentlewoman who lived \n",

      "fingers, his legs thrown back and his eyes rolling as he War and Peace  \n",
      "782 of 2882 \n",
      "sang, with his small, husky, but true voice, some verses \n",
      "called ‘Enchantress,’ which he had composed, and to \n",

      "Enchantress, say, to my forsaken lyre \n",
      "What magic power is th is recalls me still? \n",
      "What spark has set my inmost soul on fire, \n",

      "happy Natasha. \n",
      "‘Splendid! Excellent!’ ex claimed Natasha. ‘Another \n",

      "Nicholas went to her, kissed her hand, and sitting down \n",

      "‘All wight! All wight!’ shouted Denisov. ‘It’s no good \n",

      "The countess glanced at her silent son. \n",

      "784 of 2882 \n",
      "Sonya struck the first chord of the prelude. \n",
      "‘My God, I’m a ruined and dishonored man! A bullet \n",
      "through my brain is the only th ing left me- not singing! ‘ \n",
      "his thoughts ran on. ‘Go away? But where to? It’s one- let \n",
      "them sing!’ \n",
      "He continued to pace the room, looking gloomily at \n",
      "Denisov and the girls and avoiding their eyes. \n",
      "‘Nikolenka, what is the matter?’ Sonya’s eyes fixed on \n",
      "him seemed to ask. She noticed at once that something \n",

      "Nicholas turned away from he r. Natasha too, with her \n",
      "quick instinct, had instan tly noticed her brother’s \n",

      "such high spirits at that mo ment, so far from sorrow, \n",
      "sadness, or self-reproach, th at she purposely deceived \n",
      "herself as young people often do. ‘No, I am too happy \n",
      "now to spoil my enjoyment by sympathy with anyone’s \n",

      "mistaken, he must be feeling happy, just as I am.’ \n",
      "‘Now, Sonya!’ she said, going to the very middle of \n",
      "the room, where she considered the resonance was best. \n",
      "Having lifted her head and let her arms droop \n",
      "lifelessly, as ballet dan cers do, Natasha, rising \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "785 of 2882 \n",
      "energetically from her heels to her toes, stepped to the \n",
      "middle of the room and stood still. \n",
      "‘Yes, that’s me!’ she seemed to say, answering the rapt \n",
      "gaze with which Denisov followed her. \n",
      "‘And what is she so pleased about?’ thought Nicholas, \n",
      "looking at his sister. ‘Why isn’t she dull and ashamed?’ \n",
      "Natasha took the first note, her throat swelled, her \n",
      "chest rose, her eyes became se rious. At that moment she \n",
      "was oblivious of her surroundings, and from her smiling \n",
      "lips flowed sounds which anyone may produce at the \n",
      "same intervals hold for the same time, but which leave \n",
      "you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time \n",
      "thrill you and make you weep. \n",
      "Natasha, that winter, had for the first time begun to \n",
      "sing seriously, mainly because Denisov so delighted in \n",
      "her singing. She no longer sa ng as a child, there was no \n",
      "longer in her singing that co mical, childish, painstaking \n",
      "effect that had been in it before; but she did not yet sing \n",
      "well, as all the connoisseurs who heard her said: ‘It is not \n",
      "trained, but it is a beautiful voice that must be trained.’ \n",
      "Only they generally said this some time after she had \n",
      "finished singing. While that  untrained voice, with its \n",
      "incorrect breathing and labored transitions, was sounding, \n",
      "even the connoisseurs said not hing, but only delighted in War and Peace  \n",
      "786 of 2882 \n",
      "it and wished to hear it again. In her voice there was a \n",
      "virginal freshness, an unc onsciousness of her own \n",
      "powers, and an as yet untrained velvety softness, which so \n",
      "mingled with her lack of art in singing that it seemed as if \n",
      "nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling it. \n",
      "‘What is this?’ thought Nicholas, listening to her with \n",
      "widely opened eyes. ‘What has happened to her? How she \n",
      "is singing today!’ And suddenly the whole world centered \n",
      "for him on anticipation of the next note, the next phrase, \n",
      "and everything in the world wa s divided into three beats: \n",
      "‘Oh mio crudele affetto.’... On e, two, three... one, two, \n",

      "Nicholas. ‘All this misery, and money, and Dolokhov, and \n",
      "anger, and honor- it’s all nonsense... but this is real.... \n",
      "Now then, Natasha, now then, dearest! Now then, darling! \n",
      "How will she take that si? She’s taken it! Thank God!’ \n",
      "And without noticing that he  was singing, to strengthen \n",
      "the si he sung a second, a th ird below the high note. ‘Ah, \n",
      "God! How fine! Did I really take it? How fortunate!’ he \n",
      "thought. \n",
      "Oh, how that chord vibrated, and how moved was \n",
      "something that was finest in Rostov’s soul! And this \n",
      "something was apart from everything else in the world \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "787 of 2882 \n",
      "and above everything in the world. ‘What were losses, \n",

      "788 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XVI \n",
      "It was long since Rostov had felt such enjoyment from \n",
      "music as he did that day. But no sooner had Natasha \n",
      "finished her barcarolle than reality again presented itself. \n",
      "He got up without saying a word  and went downstairs to \n",
      "his own room. A quarter of an hour later the old count \n",
      "came in from his Club, cheerfu l and contented. Nicholas, \n",
      "hearing him drive up, went to meet him. \n",
      "‘Well- had a good time?’ said the old count, smiling \n",
      "gaily and proudly at his son. \n",
      "Nicholas tried to say ‘Yes,’ but could not: and he \n",
      "nearly burst into sobs. The count was lighting his pipe and \n",
      "did not notice his son’s condition. \n",
      "‘Ah, it can’t be avoided!’ thought Nicholas, for the \n",
      "first and last time. And suddenly, in the most casual tone, \n",
      "which made him feel ashamed f eel of himself, he said, as \n",
      "if merely asking his father to let him have the carriage to \n",
      "drive to town: \n",
      "‘Papa, I have come on a matter of business. I was \n",
      "nearly forgetting. I need some money.’ \n",
      "‘Dear me!’ said his father, who was in a specially good \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "789 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Very much,’ said Nicholas flushing, and with a stupid \n",
      "careless smile, for which he was long unable to forgive \n",
      "himself, ‘I have lost a little, I mean a good deal, a great \n",
      "deal- forty three thousand.’ \n",
      "‘What! To whom?... Nonsense!’ cried the count, \n",
      "suddenly reddening with an apoplectic flush over neck \n",
      "and nape as old people do. \n",
      "‘I promised to pay tomorrow,’ said Nicholas. \n",
      "‘Well!...’ said the old count , spreading out his arms \n",
      "and sinking helplessly on the sofa. \n",
      "‘It can’t be helped It happe ns to everyone!’ said the \n",
      "son, with a bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he \n",
      "regarded himself as a wort hless scoundrel whose whole \n",
      "life could not atone for his cr ime. He longed to kiss his \n",
      "father’s hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness, but said, \n",
      "in a careless and even rude voice, that it happens to \n",
      "everyone! \n",

      "‘No, not on any account! I w ill tell him myself, and \n",
      "you’ll listen at the door,’ and Natasha ran across the \n",

      "After his interview with his wife Pierre left for \n",
      "Petersburg. At the Torzhok post station, either there were \n",
      "no horses or the postmaster would not supply them. Pierre \n",
      "was obliged to wait. Without undressing, he lay down on \n",
      "the leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big feet in \n",
      "their overboots on the table, and began to reflect. \n",
      "‘Will you have the portmanteaus brought in? And a \n",
      "bed got ready, and tea?’ asked his valet. \n",
      "Pierre gave no answer, for he neither heard nor saw \n",
      "anything. He had begun to think of the last station and \n",
      "was still pondering on the same question- one so \n",
      "important that he took no no tice of what went on around \n",
      "him. Not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to \n",
      "Petersburg earlier or late r, or whether he secured \n",
      "accommodation at this station, but compared to the \n",
      "thoughts that now occupied  him it was a matter of \n",
      "indifference whether he remained there for a few hours or \n",
      "for the rest of his life. \n",
      "The postmaster, his wife, the valet, and a peasant \n",
      "woman selling Torzhok embroidery came into the room \n",
      "offering their services. W ithout changing his careless \n",
      "attitude, Pierre looked at th em over his spectacles unable \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "797 of 2882 \n",
      "to understand what they want ed or how they could go on \n",
      "living without having solv ed the problems that so \n",
      "absorbed him. He had been engrossed by the same \n",
      "thoughts ever since the day he  returned from Sokolniki \n",
      "after the duel and had spent that first agonizing, sleepless \n",
      "night. But now, in the solitude of the journey, they seized \n",
      "him with special force. No matter what he thought about, \n",
      "he always returned to these same questions which he \n",
      "could not solve and yet could not cease to ask himself. It \n",
      "was as if the thread of the chief screw which held his life \n",
      "together were stripped, so that the screw could not get in \n",
      "or out, but went on turning uselessly in the same place. \n",
      "The postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg \n",
      "his excellency to wait only two hours, when, come what \n",
      "might, he would let his exce llency have the courier \n",
      "horses. It was plain that he was lying and only wanted to \n",
      "get more money from the traveler. \n",
      "‘Is this good or bad?’ Pierre asked himself. ‘It is good \n",
      "for me, bad for another traveler, and for himself it’s \n",
      "unavoidable, because he need s money for food; the man \n",
      "said an officer had once give n him a thrashing for letting \n",
      "a private traveler have the c ourier horses. But the officer \n",
      "thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as \n",
      "possible. And I,’ continued Pierre, ‘shot Dolokhov War and Peace  \n",
      "798 of 2882 \n",
      "because I considered myself injured, and Louis XVI was \n",
      "executed because they considered him a criminal, and a \n",
      "year later they executed thos e who executed him- also for \n",
      "some reason. What is bad? What is good? What should \n",

      "There was no answer to any of these questions, except \n",
      "one, and that not a logical answ er and not at all a reply to \n",
      "them. The answer was: ‘Y ou’ll die and all will end. \n",
      "You’ll die and know all, or cease asking.’ But dying was \n",

      "The Torzhok peddler woman, in a whining voice, went \n",

      "do with, and she stands in her tattered cloak looking \n",
      "timidly at me,’ he thought. ‘And what does she want the \n",
      "money for? As if that money could add a hair’s breadth to \n",
      "happiness or peace of mind. Can anything in the world \n",
      "make her or me less a prey to evil and death?- death \n",
      "which ends all and must come today or tomorrow- at any \n",
      "rate, in an instant as compared with eternity.’ And again \n",
      "he twisted the screw with the stripped thread, and again it \n",

      "His servant handed him a half-cut novel, in the form of \n",
      "letters, by Madame de Souza. He began reading about the \n",
      "sufferings and virtuous struggles of a certain Emilie de \n",
      "Mansfeld. ‘And why did she re sist her seducer when she \n",

      "she once was- did not struggle, and perhaps she was right. \n",
      "Nothing has been found out, nothing discove red,’ Pierre \n",
      "again said to himself. ‘All we can know is that we know \n",
      "nothing. And that’s the height of human wisdom.’ \n",
      "Everything within and ar ound him seemed confused, \n",
      "senseless, and repellent. Yet in this very repugnance to all \n",
      "his circumstances Pierre found a kind of tantalizing \n",
      "satisfaction. \n",
      "‘I make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for \n",
      "this gentleman,’ said the postmaster, entering the room \n",
      "followed by another traveler, al so detained for lack of \n",
      "horses. \n",
      "The newcomer was a short, large-boned, yellow-faced, \n",
      "wrinkled old man, with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging \n",
      "bright eyes of an indefinite grayish color. \n",
      "Pierre took his feet off the table, stood up, and lay \n",
      "down on a bed that had been got ready for him, glancing \n",
      "now and then at the newcomer, who, with a gloomy and War and Peace  \n",
      "800 of 2882 \n",
      "tired face, was wearily taking off his wraps with the aid of \n",
      "his servant, and not looking at Pierre. With a pair of felt \n",
      "boots on his thin bony legs, and keeping on a worn, \n",
      "nankeen-covered, sheepskin coat, the traveler sat down on \n",
      "the sofa, leaned back his big head with its broad temples \n",
      "and close-cropped hair, and looked at Bezukhov. The \n",
      "stern, shrewd, and penetrati ng expression of that look \n",
      "struck Pierre. He felt a wish to speak to the stranger, but \n",
      "by the time he had made up his mind to ask him a \n",
      "question about the roads, the traveler had closed his eyes. \n",
      "His shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of \n",
      "one of them Pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a \n",
      "seal representing a death’s head. The stranger sat without \n",
      "stirring, either resti ng or, as it seemed to Pierre, sunk in \n",
      "profound and calm meditation. His servant was also a \n",
      "yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or mustache, \n",
      "evidently not because he was shaven but because they had \n",
      "never grown. This active ol d servant was unpacking the \n",
      "traveler’s canteen and prepar ing tea. He brought in a \n",
      "boiling samovar. When everything was ready, the stranger \n",
      "opened his eyes, moved to the table, filled a tumbler with \n",
      "tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom \n",
      "he passed it. Pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "801 of 2882 \n",
      "and the need, even the inevitability, of entering into \n",
      "conversation with this stranger. \n",
      "The servant brought back hi s tumbler turned upside \n",
      "down,* with an unfinished bit of nibbled sugar, and asked \n",
      "if anything more would be wanted. \n",
      "*To indicate he did not want more tea. \n",
      "‘No. Give me the book,’ said the stranger. \n",
      "The servant handed him a book which Pierre took to be \n",
      "a devotional work, and the traveler became absorbed in it. \n",
      "Pierre looked at him. All at once the stranger closed the \n",
      "book, putting in a marker, and again, leaning with his \n",
      "arms on the back of the sofa , sat in his former position \n",
      "with his eyes shut. Pierre looked at him and had not time \n",
      "to turn away when the old man, opening his eyes, fixed \n",
      "his steady and severe gaze straight on Pierre’s face. \n",
      "Pierre felt confused and wish ed to avoid that look, but \n",
      "the bright old eyes attracted him irresistibly. War and Peace  \n",
      "802 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter II \n",
      "‘I have the pleasure of addressing Count Bezukhov, if I \n",
      "am not mistaken,’ said the stranger in a deliberate and \n",
      "loud voice. \n",
      "Pierre looked silen tly and inquiringly at him over his \n",
      "spectacles. \n",
      "‘I have heard of you, my dear sir, ‘continued the \n",
      "stranger, ‘and of your misfortune.’ He seemed to \n",
      "emphasize the last word, as if to say- ‘Yes, misfortune! \n",
      "Call it what you please, I know that what happened to you \n",
      "in Moscow was a misfortune.’- ‘I regret it very much, my \n",
      "dear sir.’ \n",
      "Pierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs down \n",
      "from the bed, bent forward toward the old man with a \n",
      "forced and timid smile. \n",
      "‘I have not referred to this out of curiosity, my dear sir, \n",
      "but for greater reasons.’ \n",
      "He paused, his gaze still on Pierre, and moved aside on \n",
      "the sofa by way of inviting the other to take a seat beside \n",
      "him. Pierre felt reluctant to enter into conversation with \n",
      "this old man, but, submitting to him involuntarily, came \n",
      "up and sat down beside him. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "803 of 2882 \n",
      "‘You are unhappy, my dear sir,’ the stranger continued. \n",
      "‘You are young and I am old. I should like to help you as \n",
      "far as lies in my power.’ \n",
      "‘Oh, yes!’ said Pierre, with a forced smile. ‘I am very \n",
      "grateful to you. Where are you traveling from?’ \n",
      "The stranger’s face was not genial, it was even cold \n",
      "and severe, but in spite of th is, both the face and words of \n",
      "his new acquaintance were irresistibly attractive to Pierre. \n",
      "‘But if for reason you don’t feel inclined to talk to me,’ \n",
      "said the old man, ‘say so, my dear sir.’ And he suddenly \n",
      "smiled, in an unexpected and tenderly paternal way. \n",
      "‘Oh no, not at all! On the contrary, I am very glad to \n",
      "make your acquaintance,’ said Pierre. And again, glancing \n",
      "at the stranger’s hands, he looked more closely at the ring, \n",
      "with its skull- a Masonic sign. \n",
      "‘Allow me to ask,’ he said, ‘are you a Mason?’ \n",
      "‘Yes, I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons,’ \n",
      "said the stranger, looking deep er and deeper into Pierre’s \n",
      "eyes. ‘And in their name and my own I hold out a \n",
      "brotherly hand to you.’ \n",
      "‘I am afraid,’ said Pierre, smiling, and wavering \n",
      "between the confidence the personality of the Freemason \n",
      "inspired in him and his ow n habit of ridiculing the \n",
      "Masonic beliefs- ‘I am afraid I am very far from War and Peace  \n",
      "804 of 2882 \n",
      "understanding- how am I to put it?- I am afraid my way of \n",
      "looking at the world is so oppos ed to yours that we shall \n",
      "not understand one another.’ \n",
      "‘I know your outlook,’ said the Mason, ‘and the view \n",
      "of life you mention, and which you think is the result of \n",
      "your own mental efforts, is the one held by the majority of \n",
      "people, and is the invariable fruit of pride, indolence, and \n",
      "ignorance. Forgive me, my d ear sir, but if I had not \n",
      "known it I should not have a ddressed you. Your view of \n",
      "life is a regrettable delusion.’ \n",
      "‘Just as I may suppose you to be deluded,’ said Pierre, \n",
      "with a faint smile. \n",
      "‘I should never dare to say th at I know the truth,’ said \n",
      "the Mason, whose words struck Pierre more and more by \n",
      "their precision and firmness. ‘No one can attain to truth \n",
      "by himself. Only by laying stone on stone with the \n",
      "cooperation of all, by the millions of generations from our \n",
      "forefather Adam to our own times, is that temple reared \n",
      "which is to be a worthy dwelling place of the Great God,’ \n",
      "he added, and closed his eyes. \n",
      "‘I ought to tell you that I do not believe... do not \n",
      "believe in God, said Pierre, regretfully and with an effort, \n",
      "feeling it essential to speak the whole truth. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "805 of 2882 \n",
      "The Mason looked intently at Pierre and smiled as a \n",
      "rich man with millions in hand might smile at a poor \n",
      "fellow who told him that he, poor man, had not the five \n",
      "rubles that would make him happy. \n",
      "‘Yes, you do not know Him, my  dear sir,’ said the \n",
      "Mason. ‘You cannot know Him. You do not know Him \n",
      "and that is why you are unhappy.’ \n",
      "‘Yes, yes, I am unhappy,’ a ssented Pierre. ‘But what \n",
      "am I to do?’ \n",
      "‘You know Him not, my dear sir, and so you are very \n",
      "unhappy. You do not know Him, but  He is here, He is in \n",
      "me, He is in my words, He is in thee, and even in those \n",
      "blasphemous words thou hast just uttered!’ pronounced \n",
      "the Mason in a stern and tremulous voice. \n",
      "He paused and sighed, evidently trying to calm \n",
      "himself. \n",
      "‘If He were not,’ he said quietly, ‘you and I would not \n",
      "be speaking of Him, my dear sir. Of what, of whom, are \n",
      "we speaking? Whom hast thou denied?’ he suddenly \n",
      "asked with exulting austerity and authority in his voice. \n",
      "‘Who invented Him, if He did not exist? Whence came \n",
      "thy conception of the ex istence of such an \n",
      "incomprehensible Being? didst thou, and why did the \n",
      "whole world, conceive the idea of the existence of such an War and Peace  \n",
      "806 of 2882 \n",
      "incomprehensible Being, a Being all-powerful, eternal, \n",
      "and infinite in all His attributes?..’ \n",
      "He stopped and remained silent for a long time. \n",
      "Pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence. \n",
      "‘He exists, but to understand Him is hard,’ the Mason \n",
      "began again, looking not at Pie rre but straight before him, \n",
      "and turning the leaves of his book with his old hands \n",
      "which from excitement he coul d not keep still. ‘If it were \n",
      "a man whose existence thou didst doubt I could bring him \n",
      "to thee, could take him by th e hand and show him to thee. \n",
      "But how can I, an insignificant mortal, show His \n",
      "omnipotence, His infinity, and all His mercy to one who \n",
      "is blind, or who shuts his ey es that he may not see or \n",
      "understand Him and may not see or understand his own \n",
      "vileness and sinfulness?’ He paused again. ‘Who art thou? \n",
      "Thou dreamest that thou art wise because thou couldst \n",
      "utter those blasphemous words,’ he went on, with a \n",
      "somber and scornful smile. ‘And thou art more foolish \n",
      "and unreasonable than a little child, who, playing with the \n",
      "parts of a skillfully made watch, dares to say that, as he \n",
      "does not understand its use, he does not believe in the \n",
      "master who made it. To know Him is hard.... For ages, \n",
      "from our forefather Adam to our own day, we labor to \n",
      "attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "807 of 2882 \n",
      "aim; but in our lack of understanding we see only our \n",
      "weakness and His greatness...’ \n",
      "Pierre listened with swelling heart, gazing into the \n",
      "Mason’s face with shining eyes, not interrupting or \n",
      "questioning him, but believing with his whole soul what \n",
      "the stranger said. Whether he accepted the wise reasoning \n",
      "contained in the Mason’s words, or believed as a child \n",
      "believes, in the speaker’s  tone of conviction and \n",
      "earnestness, or the tremor of  the speaker’s voice- which \n",
      "sometimes almost broke- or those brilliant aged eyes \n",
      "grown old in this conviction,  or the calm firmness and \n",
      "certainty of his vocation, which radiated from his whole \n",
      "being (and which struck Pierre especially by contrast with \n",
      "his own dejection and hopelessn ess)- at any rate, Pierre \n",
      "longed with his whole soul to believe and he did believe, \n",
      "and felt a joyful sense of comfort, regeneration, and return \n",
      "to life. \n",
      "‘He is not to be apprehended by reason, but by life,’ \n",
      "said the Mason. \n",
      "‘I do not understand,’ said Pierre, feeling with dismay \n",
      "doubts reawakening. He was afraid of any want of \n",
      "clearness, any weakness, in the Mason’s arguments; he \n",
      "dreaded not to be able to believe in him. ‘I don’t \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "808 of 2882 \n",
      "understand,’ he said, ‘how it is that the mind of man \n",
      "cannot attain the knowledge of which you speak.’ \n",
      "The Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile. \n",
      "‘The highest wisdom and truth are like the purest \n",
      "liquid we may wish to imbibe ,’ he said. ‘Can I receive \n",
      "that pure liquid into an impure vessel and judge of its \n",
      "purity? Only by the inner purif ication of myself can I \n",
      "retain in some degree of purity the liquid I receive.’ \n",
      "‘Yes, yes, that is so,’ said Pierre joyfully. \n",
      "‘The highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone, \n",
      "not on those worldly scienc es of physics, history, \n",
      "chemistry, and the like, into which intellectual knowledge \n",
      "is divided. The highest wisdom is one. The highest \n",
      "wisdom has but one science- the science of the whole- the \n",
      "science explaining the whole creation and man’s place in \n",
      "it. To receive that science it is necessary to purify and \n",
      "renew one’s inner self, and so before one can know, it is \n",

      "profligate life. That is what you have done. Have you \n",
      "chosen a post in which you might be of service to your \n",
      "neighbor? No! You have spent your life in idleness. Then \n",
      "you married, my dear sir- took  on yourself responsibility \n",
      "for the guidance of a young woman; and what have you \n",
      "done? You have not helped he r to find the way of truth, \n",
      "my dear sir, but have thrust her into an abyss of deceit and \n",
      "misery. A man offended you and you shot him, and you \n",

      "After these words, the Mas on, as if tired by his long \n",
      "discourse, again leaned his arms on the back of the sofa \n",
      "and closed his eyes. Pierre looked at that aged, stern, \n",
      "motionless, almost lifeless face and moved his lips \n",
      "without uttering a sound. He wished to say, ‘Yes, a vile, \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "811 of 2882 \n",
      "finished, he turned to Bezukhov, and said in a tone of \n",

      "‘Where are you going to now, my dear sir?’ \n",

      "my whole soul I wish to be what you would have me be, \n",

      "‘Yes... yes, I believe in God,’ he said. \n",

      "‘Yes, I do believe in God,’ he repeated. \n",
      "‘In that case we can go,’ said Willarski. ‘My carriage \n",

      "Willarski was silent throughout the drive. To Pierre’s \n",
      "inquiries as to what he must do and how he should \n",

      "Having entered the courtyard of a large house where \n",

      "dark staircase, they entered a small well-lit anteroom \n",
      "where they took off their cl oaks without the aid of a \n",
      "servant. From there they passed into another room. A man \n",
      "in strange attire appeared at the door. Willarski, stepping \n",
      "toward him, said something to him in French in an \n",
      "undertone and then went up to a small wardrobe in which \n",
      "Pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen before. \n",
      "Having taken a kerchief from the cupboard, Willarski \n",
      "bound Pierre’s eyes with it an d tied it in a knot behind, \n",
      "catching some hairs painfully in the knot. Then he drew \n",
      "his face down, kissed him, and taking him by the hand led \n",
      "him forward. The hairs tied in  the knot hurt Pierre and \n",
      "there were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced \n",
      "smile. His huge figure, with arms hanging down and with \n",

      "816 of 2882 \n",
      "added Willarski. ‘I wish you courage and success,’ and, \n",
      "pressing Pierre’s hand, he went out. \n",
      "Left alone, Pierre went on smiling in the same way. \n",
      "Once or twice he shrugged hi s and raised his hand to the \n",
      "kerchief, as if wishing to take  it off, but let it drop again. \n",
      "The five minutes spent with his eyes bandaged seemed to \n",
      "him an hour. His arms felt num b, his legs almost gave \n",
      "way, it seemed to him that he was tired out. He \n",
      "experienced a variety of most  complex sensations. He felt \n",
      "afraid of what would happen to  him and still more afraid \n",
      "of showing his fear. He fe lt curious to know what was \n",
      "going to happen and what would be revealed to him; but \n",
      "most of all, he felt joyful that the moment had come when \n",
      "he would at last start on that  path of regeneration and on \n",
      "the actively virtuous life of which he had been dreaming \n",
      "since he met Joseph Alexeev ich. Loud knocks were heard \n",
      "at the door. Pierre took the bandage off his eyes and \n",
      "glanced around him. The room  was in black darkness, \n",
      "only a small lamp was burning inside something white. \n",
      "Pierre went nearer and saw th at the lamp stood on a black \n",
      "table on which lay an open book. The book was the \n",
      "Gospel, and the white thing with the lamp inside was a \n",
      "human skull with its cavities and teeth. After reading the \n",
      "first words of the Gospel: ‘In the beginning was the Word \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "817 of 2882 \n",
      "and the Word was with God,’ Pierre went round the table \n",
      "and saw a large open box filled with something. It was a \n",
      "coffin with bones inside. He wa s not at all surprised by \n",
      "what he saw. Hoping to enter on an entirely new life quite \n",
      "unlike the old one, he expected everything to be unusual, \n",
      "even more unusual than what he was seeing. A skull, a \n",
      "coffin, the Gospel- it seemed to him that he had expected \n",
      "all this and even more. Tryi ng to stimulate his emotions \n",
      "he looked around. ‘God, death, love, the brotherhood of \n",
      "man,’ he kept saying to himself, associating these words \n",
      "with vague yet joyful id eas. The door opened and \n",
      "someone came in. \n",
      "By the dim light, to which Pierre had already become \n",
      "accustomed, he saw rather short man. Having evidently \n",
      "come from the light into the darkness, the man paused, \n",
      "then moved with cautious steps toward the table and \n",
      "placed on it his small leather-gloved hands. \n",
      "This short man had on a white leather apron which \n",
      "covered his chest and part of his legs; he had on a kind of \n",
      "necklace above which rose a high white ruffle, outlining \n",
      "his rather long face which was lit up from below. \n",
      "‘For what have you come hither?’ asked the \n",
      "newcomer, turning in Pierre’s direction at a slight rustle \n",
      "made by the latter. ‘Why have you, who do not believe in War and Peace  \n",
      "818 of 2882 \n",
      "the truth of the light and w ho have not seen the light, \n",
      "come here? What do you seek  from us? Wisdom, virtue, \n",
      "enlightenment?’ \n",
      "At the moment the door opened and the stranger came \n",
      "in, Pierre felt a sense of aw e and veneration such as he \n",
      "had experienced in his boyhood at confession; he felt \n",
      "himself in the presence of one socially a complete \n",
      "stranger, yet nearer to hi m through the brotherhood of \n",
      "man. With bated breath and beating heart he moved \n",
      "toward the Rhetor (by which name the brother who \n",
      "prepared a seeker for entran ce into the Brotherhood was \n",
      "known). Drawing nearer, he r ecognized in the Rhetor a \n",
      "man he knew, Smolyaninov, and it mortified him to think \n",
      "that the newcomer was an acquaintance- he wished him \n",
      "simply a brother and a virtuous instructor. For a long time \n",
      "he could not utter a word, so th at the Rhetor had to repeat \n",
      "his question. \n",
      "‘Yes... I... I... desire regenera tion,’ Pierre uttered with \n",
      "difficulty. \n",
      "‘Very well,’ said Smolyaninov, and went on at once: \n",
      "‘Have you any idea of the means by which our holy Order \n",
      "will help you to reach your aim?’ said he quietly and \n",
      "quickly. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "819 of 2882 \n",
      "‘I... hope... for guidance... help... in regeneration,’ said \n",
      "Pierre, with a trembling voice and some difficulty in \n",
      "utterance due to his excitement and to being \n",
      "unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in Russian. \n",
      "‘What is your conception of Freemasonry?’ \n",
      "‘I imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and \n",
      "equality of men who have vi rtuous aims,’ said Pierre, \n",
      "feeling ashamed of the inadequacy of his words for the \n",
      "solemnity of the moment, as he spoke. ‘I imagine..’ \n",
      "‘Good!’ said the Rhetor quick ly, apparently satisfied \n",
      "with this answer. ‘Have you sought for means of attaining \n",
      "your aim in religion?’ \n",
      "‘No, I considered it erroneous and did not follow it,’ \n",
      "said Pierre, so softly that th e Rhetor did not hear him and \n",
      "asked him what he was saying. ‘I have been an atheist,’ \n",
      "answered Pierre. \n",
      "‘You are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in \n",
      "your life, therefore you seek wisdom and virtue. Is that \n",
      "not so?’ said the Rhetor, after a moment’s pause. \n",
      "‘Yes, yes,’ assented Pierre. \n",
      "The Rhetor cleared his throat, crossed his gloved hands \n",
      "on his breast, and began to speak. \n",
      "‘Now I must disclose to  you the chief aim of our \n",
      "Order,’ he said, ‘and if this aim coincides with yours, you \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "820 of 2882 \n",
      "may enter our Brotherhood with profit. The first and chief \n",
      "object of our Order, the f oundation on which it rests and \n",
      "which no human power can destroy, is the preservation \n",
      "and handing on to posterity of a certain important \n",
      "mystery... which has come down to us from the remotest \n",
      "ages, even from the first man- a mystery on which \n",
      "perhaps the fate of mankind depends. But since this \n",
      "mystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use it \n",
      "unless he be prepared by long and diligent self-\n",
      "purification, not everyone can  hope to attain it quickly. \n",
      "Hence we have a secondary aim, that of preparing our \n",
      "members as much as possible to reform their hearts, to \n",
      "purify and enlighten their minds, by means handed on to \n",
      "us by tradition from those who have striven to attain this \n",
      "mystery, and thereby to render them capable of receiving \n",
      "it. \n",
      "‘By purifying and regenerating our members we try, \n",
      "thirdly, to improve the whole human race, offering it in \n",
      "our members an example of pi ety and virtue, and thereby \n",
      "try with all our might to combat the evil which sways the \n",
      "world. Think this over and I will come to you again.’ \n",
      "‘To combat the evil which sways the world...’ Pierre \n",
      "repeated, and a mental image of his future activity in this \n",
      "direction rose in his mind. He imagined men such as he \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "821 of 2882 \n",
      "had himself been a fortnight ago, and he addressed an \n",
      "edifying exhortation to them. He imagined to himself \n",
      "vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by \n",
      "word and deed, imagined oppressors whose victims he \n",
      "would rescue. Of the three objects mentioned by the \n",
      "Rhetor, this last, that of  improving mankind, especially \n",
      "appealed to Pierre. The impor tant mystery mentioned by \n",
      "the Rhetor, though it aroused hi s curiosity, did not seem \n",
      "to him essential, and the second aim, that of purifying and \n",
      "regenerating himself, did not  much interest him because \n",
      "at that moment he felt with  delight that he was already \n",
      "perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for all \n",
      "that was good. \n",
      "Half an hour later, the Rhetor returned to inform the \n",
      "seeker of the seven virtues,  corresponding to the seven \n",
      "steps of Solomon’s temple, which every Freemason \n",
      "should cultivate in himsel f. These virtues were: 1. \n",
      "Discretion, the keeping of the secrets of the Order. 2. \n",
      "Obedience to those of higher ranks in the Order. 3. \n",
      "Morality. 4. Love of manki nd. 5. Courage. 6. Generosity. \n",
      "7. The love of death. \n",
      "‘In the seventh place, try, by the frequent thought of \n",
      "death,’ the Rhetor said, ‘to bring yourself to regard it not \n",
      "as a dreaded foe, but as a friend that frees the soul grown War and Peace  \n",
      "822 of 2882 \n",
      "weary in the labors of virtue fr om this distressful life, and \n",
      "leads it to its place of recompense and peace.’ \n",
      "‘Yes, that must be so,’ thought Pierre, when after these \n",
      "words the Rhetor went away, leaving him to solitary \n",
      "meditation. ‘It must be so, but  I am still so weak that I \n",
      "love my life, the meaning of which is only now gradually \n",
      "opening before me.’ But five of the other virtues which \n",
      "Pierre recalled, c ounting them on his fingers, he felt \n",
      "already in his soul: courage, generosity, morality, love of \n",
      "mankind, and especially obedience- which did not even \n",
      "seem to him a virtue, but a joy. (He now felt so glad to be \n",
      "free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will to \n",
      "those who knew the indubitable truth.) He forgot what the \n",
      "seventh virtue was and could not recall it. \n",
      "The third time the Rhetor came back more quickly and \n",
      "asked Pierre whether he was s till firm in his intention and \n",
      "determined to submit to all that would be required of him. \n",
      "‘I am ready for everything,’ said Pierre. \n",
      "‘I must also inform you,’ said the Rhetor, ‘that our \n",
      "Order delivers its teaching not in words only but also by \n",
      "other means, which may perhaps have a stronger effect on \n",
      "the sincere seeker after wisdom and virtue than mere \n",
      "words. This chamber with what you see therein should \n",
      "already have suggested to your h eart, if it is sincere, more \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "823 of 2882 \n",
      "than words could do. You will  perhaps also see in your \n",
      "further initiation a like me thod of enlightenment. Our \n",
      "Order imitates the ancient societies that explained their \n",
      "teaching by hieroglyphics. A hieroglyph,’ said the Rhetor, \n",
      "‘is an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses \n",
      "but which possesses qualitie s resembling those of the \n",
      "symbol.’ \n",
      "Pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was, but \n",
      "dared not speak. He listened to  the Rhetor in silence, \n",
      "feeling from all he said that his ordeal was about to begin. \n",
      "‘If you are resolved, I must begin your initiation,’ said \n",
      "the Rhetor coming closer to Pierre. ‘In token of generosity \n",

      "Pierre quickly took out his purse and watch, but could \n",
      "not manage for some time to get the wedding ring off his \n",
      "fat finger. When that had been done, the Rhetor said: \n",
      "‘In token of obedience, I ask you to undress.’ \n",
      "Pierre took off his coat, waistcoat, and left boot \n",
      "according to the Rhetor’s instructions. The Mason drew \n",
      "the shirt back from Pierre’s left breast, and stooping down \n",
      "pulled up the left leg of his trousers to above the knee. War and Peace  \n",
      "824 of 2882 \n",
      "Pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also and \n",
      "was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this \n",
      "stranger the trouble, but the Ma son told him that was not \n",
      "necessary and gave him a slipper for his left foot. With a \n",
      "childlike smile of embarrassment, doubt, and self-\n",
      "derision, which appeared on his face against his will, \n",
      "Pierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart, \n",
      "before his brother Rhetor , and awaited his further \n",
      "commands. \n",
      "‘And now, in token of candor, I ask you to reveal to \n",
      "me your chief passion,’ said the latter. \n",
      "‘My passion! I have had so many,’ replied Pierre. \n",
      "‘That passion which more than all others caused you to \n",
      "waver on the path of virtue,’ said the Mason. \n",
      "Pierre paused, seeking a reply. \n",
      "‘Wine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Irritability? \n",
      "Anger? Women?’ He went over his vices in his mind, not \n",
      "knowing to which of them to give the pre-eminence. \n",
      "‘Women,’ he said in a low, scarcely audible voice. \n",
      "The Mason did not move and for a long time said \n",
      "nothing after this answer. At last he moved up to Pierre \n",
      "and, taking the kerchief that lay on the table, again bound \n",
      "his eyes. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "825 of 2882 \n",
      "‘For the last time I say to you- turn all your attention \n",
      "upon yourself, put a bridle on your senses, and seek \n",
      "blessedness, not in passion but in your own heart. The \n",
      "source of blessedness is not without us but within...’ \n",
      "Pierre had already long been  feeling in himself that \n",

      "Soon after this there came into the dark chamber to \n",
      "fetch Pierre, not the Rhet or but Pierre’s sponsor, \n",
      "Willarski, whom he recognized by his voice. To fresh \n",
      "questions as to the firmne ss of his resolution Pierre \n",
      "replied: ‘Yes, yes, I agree,’ and with a beaming, childlike \n",
      "smile, his fat chest uncovered, stepping unevenly and \n",
      "timidly in one slippered and one booted foot, he \n",
      "advanced, while Willarski held a sword to his bare chest. \n",
      "He was conducted from that room along passages that \n",
      "turned backwards and forwards and was at last brought to \n",
      "the doors of the Lodge. Willarski coughed, he was \n",
      "answered by the Masonic knock with mallets, the doors \n",
      "opened before them. A bass voice (Pierre was still \n",
      "blindfold) questioned him as to who he was, when and \n",
      "where he was born, and so on. Then he was again led \n",
      "somewhere still blindfold, and as they went along he was \n",
      "told allegories of the toils  of his pilgrimage, of holy \n",
      "friendship, of the Eternal Architect of the universe, and of \n",
      "the courage with which he should endure toils and \n",
      "dangers. During these wanderings, Pierre noticed that he \n",
      "was spoken of now as the ‘Seeker,’ now as the ‘Sufferer,’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "827 of 2882 \n",
      "and now as the ‘Postulant,’ to the accompaniment of \n",
      "various knockings with malle ts and swords. As he was \n",
      "being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and \n",
      "uncertainty among his conductors. He heard those around \n",
      "him disputing in whispers and one of them insisting that \n",
      "he should be led along a certain carpet. After that they \n",
      "took his right hand, placed it on something, and told him \n",
      "to hold a pair of compasses to his left breast with the other \n",
      "hand and to repeat after some one who read aloud an oath \n",
      "of fidelity to the laws of the Order. The candles were then \n",
      "extinguished and some spirit  lighted, as Pierre knew by \n",
      "the smell, and he was told that he would now see the \n",
      "lesser light. The bandage was taken off his eyes and, by \n",
      "the faint light of the burning spirit, Pierre, as in a dream, \n",
      "saw several men standing before him, wearing aprons like \n",
      "the Rhetor’s and holding swords in their hands pointed at \n",
      "his breast. Among them stood a man whose white shirt \n",
      "was stained with blood. On seeing this, Pierre moved \n",
      "forward with his breast toward the swords, meaning them \n",
      "to pierce it. But the swords were drawn back from him \n",
      "and he was at once blindfolded again. \n",
      "‘Now thou hast seen the le sser light,’ uttered a voice. \n",
      "Then the candles were relit a nd he was told that he would \n",
      "see the full light; the bandage was again removed and War and Peace  \n",
      "828 of 2882 \n",
      "more than ten voices said together: ‘Sic transit gloria \n",
      "mundi.’ \n",
      "Pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked \n",
      "about at the room and at th e people in it.  Round a long \n",
      "table covered with black sat some twelve men in garments \n",
      "like those he had already see n. Some of them Pierre had \n",
      "met in Petersburg society. In the President’s chair sat a \n",
      "young man he did not know, with a peculiar cross \n",
      "hanging from his neck. On his right sat the Italian abbe \n",
      "whom Pierre had met at Anna Pavlovna’s two years \n",
      "before. There were also present a very distinguished \n",
      "dignitary and a Swiss who had formerly been tutor at the \n",
      "Kuragins’. All maintained a solemn silence, listening to \n",
      "the words of the President, who held a mallet in his hand. \n",
      "Let into the wall was a star-shaped light. At one side of \n",
      "the table was a small carpet with various figures worked \n",
      "upon it, at the other was something resembling an altar on \n",
      "which lay a Testament and a skull. Round it stood seven \n",
      "large candlesticks like those us ed in churches. Two of the \n",
      "brothers led Pierre up to the altar, placed his feet at right \n",
      "angles, and bade him lie down, saying that he must \n",
      "prostrate himself at the Gates of the Temple. \n",
      "‘He must first receive the trowel,’ whispered one of the \n",
      "brothers. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "829 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Oh, hush, please!’ said another. \n",
      "Pierre, perplexed, looked r ound with his shortsighted \n",
      "eyes without obeying, and suddenly doubts arose in his \n",
      "mind. ‘Where am I? What am I doing? Aren’t they \n",
      "laughing at me? Shan’t I be ashamed to remember this?’ \n",
      "But these doubts only lasted a moment. Pierre glanced at \n",
      "the serious faces of those around, remembered all he had \n",
      "already gone through, and realized  that he could not stop \n",
      "halfway. He was aghast at his hesitation and, trying to \n",
      "arouse his former devotional feeling, prostrated himself \n",
      "before the Gates of the Temple . And really, the feeling of \n",
      "devotion returned to him even more strongly than before. \n",
      "When he had lain there some time, he was told to get up, \n",
      "and a white leather apron, such  as the others wore, was \n",
      "put on him: he was given a trowel and three pairs of \n",
      "gloves, and then the Grand Master addressed him. He told \n",
      "him that he should try to do not hing to stain the whiteness \n",
      "of that apron, which symboli zed strength and purity; then \n",
      "of the unexplained trowel, he to ld him to toil with it to \n",
      "cleanse his own heart from vice, and indulgently to \n",
      "smooth with it the heart of his neighbor. As to the first \n",
      "pair of gloves, a man’s, he said that Pierre could not know \n",
      "their meaning but must keep them. The second pair of \n",
      "man’s gloves he was to wear at the meetings, and finally War and Peace  \n",
      "830 of 2882 \n",
      "of the third, a pair of wo men’s gloves, he said: ‘Dear \n",
      "brother, these woman’s gl oves are intended for you too. \n",
      "Give them to the woman whom you shall honor most of \n",
      "all. This gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her \n",
      "whom you select to be your worthy helpmeet in \n",
      "Masonry.’ And after a pause, he added: ‘But beware, dear \n",
      "brother, that these gloves do not deck hands that are \n",
      "unclean.’ While the Grand Master said these last words it \n",
      "seemed to Pierre that he grew embarrassed. Pierre himself \n",
      "grew still more confused, blushed like a child till tears \n",
      "came to his eyes, began looking about him uneasily, and \n",
      "an awkward pause followed. \n",
      "This silence was broken by one of the brethren, who \n",
      "led Pierre up to the rug and began reading to him from a \n",
      "manuscript book an explanation of all the figures on it: \n",
      "the sun, the moon, a hammer, a plumb line, a trowel, a \n",
      "rough stone and a squared stone , a pillar, three windows, \n",
      "and so on. Then a place was assigned to Pierre, he was \n",
      "shown the signs of the Lodge, told the password, and at \n",
      "last was permitted to sit down. The Grand Master began \n",
      "reading the statutes. They were very long, and Pierre, \n",
      "from joy, agitation, and embarra ssment, was not in a state \n",
      "to understand what was being read. He managed to follow \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "831 of 2882 \n",
      "only the last words of the statutes and these remained in \n",
      "his mind. \n",
      "‘In our temples we recogni ze no other distinctions,’ \n",
      "read the Grand Master, ‘but those between virtue and \n",
      "vice. Beware of making any distinctions which may \n",
      "infringe equality. Fly to a brother’s aid whoever he may \n",
      "be, exhort him who goeth astr ay, raise him that falleth, \n",
      "never bear malice or enmity toward thy brother. Be kindly \n",
      "and courteous. Kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue. \n",
      "Share thy happiness with thy neighbor, and may envy \n",
      "never dim the purity of that bliss. Forgive thy enemy, do \n",
      "not avenge thyself except by doing him good. Thus \n",
      "fulfilling the highest law thou sh alt regain traces of the \n",
      "ancient dignity which thou hast lost.’ \n",
      "He finished and, getting up, embraced and kissed \n",
      "Pierre, who, with tears of j oy in his eyes, looked round \n",
      "him, not knowing how to answ er the congratulations and \n",
      "greetings from acquaintances that met him on all sides. \n",
      "He acknowledged no acquaintan ces but saw in all these \n",

      "work with them. \n",
      "The Grand Master rapped with his mallet. All the \n",

      "The day after he had been  received into the Lodge, \n",

      "symbolized God, another moral things, a third physical \n",
      "things, and the fourth a comb ination of these. Now and \n",
      "then his attention wandered from the book and the Square \n",
      "and he formed in imagination a new plan of life. On the \n",
      "previous evening at the Lodge , he had heard that a rumor \n",
      "of his duel had reached the Em peror and that it would be \n",
      "wiser for him to leave Peters burg. Pierre proposed going \n",
      "to his estates in the south and there attending to the \n",

      "834 of 2882 \n",
      "‘And why didn’t you simply come straight to me as to \n",

      "‘You behaved as becomes a man values his honor, \n",
      "perhaps too hastily, but we  won’t go into that. But \n",
      "consider the position in which you are placing her and me \n",

      "lowering his voice. ‘She is living in Moscow and you are \n",
      "here. Remember, dear boy,’ and he drew Pierre’s arm \n",
      "downwards, ‘it is simply a misunderstanding. I expect you \n",

      "she’ll come here and all will  be explained, or else, my \n",

      "to answer his father-in-law. Moreover, the words of the \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "867 of 2882 \n",
      "the chief steward, understood from this speech how they \n",

      "Despite Count Bezukhov’s enormous wealth, since he \n",

      "five hundred thousand rubles a year, Pierre felt himself far \n",
      "poorer than when his father had made him an allowance \n",

      "following budget: \n",
      "About 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the \n",
      "Land Bank, about 30,000 went for the upkeep of the \n",
      "estate near Moscow, the town house, and the allowance to \n",
      "the three princesses; about 15,000 was given in pensions \n",
      "and the same amount for asylums; 150,000 alimony was \n",
      "sent to the countess; about  70,00 went for interest on \n",
      "debts. The building of a ne w church, previously begun, \n",
      "had cost about 10,000 in each of the last two years, and he \n",
      "did not know how the rest , about 100,000 rubles, was \n",
      "spent, and almost every year he was obliged to borrow. \n",
      "Besides this the chief stewar d wrote every year telling \n",
      "him of fires and bad harvests , or of the necessity of \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "868 of 2882 \n",
      "rebuilding factories and workshops. So the first task \n",
      "Pierre had to face was one for which he had very little \n",
      "aptitude or inclination- practical business. \n",
      "He discussed estate affair s every day with his chief \n",
      "steward. But he felt that this did not forward matters at \n",
      "all. He felt that these consultations were detached from \n",
      "real affairs and did not link up with them or make them \n",
      "move. On the one hand, the chief steward put the state of \n",
      "things to him in the very worst light, pointing out the \n",
      "necessity of paying off th e debts and undertaking new \n",
      "activities with serf labor, to which Pierre did not agree. \n",
      "On the other hand, Pierre de manded that steps should be \n",

      "speedy emancipation. \n",

      "869 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Yes, yes, do so.’ \n",

      "Again whole days, weeks, and months of his life passed in \n",
      "as great a rush and were as much occupied with evening \n",
      "parties, dinners, lunches, and balls, giving him no time for \n",

      "your life and only found happiness when you began living \n",

      "glory.- And after all what is glory? The same love of \n",
      "others, a desire to do something for them, a desire for \n",
      "their approval.- So I lived for others, and not almost, but \n",
      "quite, ruined my life. And I have become calmer since I \n",
      "began to live only for myself.’ \n",
      "‘But what do you mean by living only for yourself?’ \n",

      "‘You are joking,’ replied Pi erre, growing more and \n",
      "more excited. ‘What error or evil can there be in my \n",
      "wishing to do good, and even doing a little- though I did \n",
      "very little and did it very badl y? What evil can there be in \n",
      "it if unfortunate people, our se rfs, people like ourselves, \n",

      "He is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is terrible, \n",
      "and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of \n",

      "hours late a fortnight ago he would have had a \n",

      "‘Well, there you see!’ \n",
      "‘Yes, but it is not as you imagine,’ Prince Andrew \n",

      "flogged, or sent to Siberia,  I don’t suppose they are any \n",

      "In the evening Andrew and Pierre got into the open \n",

      "at Pierre, broke the silence now and then with remarks \n",
      "which showed that he was in a good temper. \n",
      "Pointing to the fields, he spoke of the improvements he \n",
      "was making in his husbandry. \n",
      "Pierre remained gloomily silent, answering in \n",
      "monosyllables and apparently immersed in his own \n",
      "thoughts. \n",
      "He was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy, had \n",
      "gone astray, did not see the true  light, and that he, Pierre, \n",
      "ought to aid, enlighten, and raise him. But as soon as he \n",
      "thought of what he should say, he felt that Prince Andrew \n",
      "with one word, one argument, would upset all his \n",
      "teaching, and he shrank from beginning, afraid of \n",
      "exposing to possible ridicule  what to him was precious \n",
      "and sacred. \n",
      "‘No, but why do you think so?’ Pierre suddenly began, \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "891 of 2882 \n",

      "surprise. \n",
      "‘About life, about man’s de stiny. It can’t be so. I \n",
      "myself thought like that, and do you know what saved \n",
      "me? Freemasonry! No, don’t smile. Freemasonry is not a \n",

      "Freemasonry is the best expression of the best, the eternal, \n",
      "aspects of humanity.’ \n",
      "And he began to explain Freemasonry as he \n",
      "understood it to Prince Andrew. He said that Freemasonry \n",
      "is the teaching of Christianity freed from the bonds of \n",
      "State and Church, a teaching of equality, brotherhood, and \n",
      "love. \n",
      "‘Only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of \n",

      "when the noise of the wheels prevented his catching what \n",
      "Pierre said, he asked him to repeat it, and by the peculiar \n",
      "glow that came into Prince Andrew’s eyes and by his \n",

      "that Prince Andrew would not  interrupt him or laugh at \n",

      "might be, began to upbraid him for his quickness of \n",

      "can’t tell you how it offended me... because... well, for \n",
      "that reason...’ \n",

      "way at moments of deep feeling. \n",
      "‘Ah, what a mad bweed you Wostovs are!’ he \n",

      "In April the troops were enlivened by news of the \n",
      "Emperor’s arrival, but Rostov had no chance of being \n",
      "present at the review he held at Bartenstein, as the \n",
      "Pavlograds were at the outposts far beyond that place. \n",
      "They were bivouacking. Denisov and Rostov were \n",
      "living in an earth hut, dug out for them by the soldiers and \n",
      "roofed with branches and tu rf. The hut was made in the \n",
      "following manner, which had then come into vogue. A \n",
      "trench was dug three an d a half feet wide , four feet eight \n",
      "inches deep, and eight feet long. At one end of the trench, \n",
      "steps were cut out and these formed the entrance and \n",
      "vestibule. The trench itself was the room, in which the \n",
      "lucky ones, such as the squadron commander, had a \n",
      "board, lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance, to \n",
      "serve as a table. On each side  of the trench, the earth was \n",
      "cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet, and this \n",
      "did duty for bedsteads and c ouches. The roof was so \n",
      "constructed that one could st and up in the middle of the \n",
      "trench and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close \n",
      "to the table. Denisov, who was living luxuriously because \n",
      "the soldiers of his squadron liked him, had also a board in \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "919 of 2882 \n",
      "the roof at the farther end, with a piece of (broken but \n",
      "mended) glass in it for a wi ndow. When it was very cold, \n",
      "embers from the soldiers’ campfire were placed on a bent \n",
      "sheet of iron on the steps in the ‘reception room’- as \n",
      "Denisov called that part of the hut- and it was then so \n",
      "warm that the officers, of whom there were always some \n",
      "with Denisov and Rostov, sat in their shirt sleeves. \n",
      "In April, Rostov was on orderly duty. One morning, \n",
      "between seven and eight, returning after a sleepless night, \n",
      "he sent for embers, changed his rain-soaked underclothes, \n",
      "said his prayers, drank tea, got warm, then tidied up the \n",
      "things on the table and in hi s own corner, and, his face \n",
      "glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on \n",
      "but his shirt, lay down on his back, putting his arms under \n",
      "his head. He was pleasantly c onsidering the probability of \n",
      "being promoted in a few days for his last reconnoitering \n",
      "expedition, and was awaiting Denisov, who had gone out \n",
      "somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk. \n",
      "Suddenly he heard Denisov shouting in a vibrating \n",
      "voice behind the hut, evidently much excited. Rostov \n",
      "moved to the window to see whom he was speaking to, \n",
      "and saw the quartermaster, Topcheenko. War and Peace  \n",
      "920 of 2882 \n",
      "‘I ordered you not to let them that Mashka woot stuff!’ \n",
      "Denisov was shouting. ‘And I saw with my own eyes how \n",
      "Lazarchuk bwought some fwom the fields.’ \n",
      "‘I have given the order again and again, your honor, \n",
      "but they don’t obey,’ answered the quartermaster. \n",
      "Rostov lay down again on his bed and thought \n",
      "complacently: ‘Let him fuss and bustle now, my job’s \n",
      "done and I’m lying down- capitally!’ He could hear that \n",
      "Lavrushka- that sly, bold or derly of Denisov’s- was \n",
      "talking, as well as the qua rtermaster. Lavrushka was \n",
      "saying something about load ed wagons, biscuits, and \n",
      "oxen he had seen when he had gone out for provisions. \n",
      "Then Denisov’s voice was heard shouting farther and \n",
      "farther away. ‘Saddle! Second platoon!’ \n",
      "‘Where are they off to now?’ thought Rostov. \n",
      "Five minutes later, Denisov came into the hut, climbed \n",
      "with muddy boots on the bed, lit his pipe, furiously \n",
      "scattered his things about, took his leaded whip, buckled \n",
      "on his saber, and went out ag ain. In answer to Rostov’s \n",
      "inquiry where he was going, he answered vaguely and \n",
      "crossly that he had some business. \n",
      "‘Let God and our gweat monarch judge me \n",
      "afterwards!’ said Denisov going out, and Rostov heard the \n",
      "hoofs of several horses splashing through the mud. He did \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "921 of 2882 \n",
      "not even trouble to find out where Denisov had gone. \n",
      "Having got warm in his corner, he fell asleep and did not \n",
      "leave the hut till toward ev ening. Denisov had not yet \n",
      "returned. The weather had clea red up, and near the next \n",
      "hut two officers and a cadet were playing svayka, \n",
      "laughing as they threw their missiles which buried \n",
      "themselves in the soft mud. Rostov joined them. In the \n",
      "middle of the game, the officers saw some wagons \n",
      "approaching with fifteen hu ssars on their skinny horses \n",
      "behind them. The wagons escorted by the hussars drew up \n",
      "to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded \n",
      "them. \n",
      "‘There now, Denisov has been worrying,’ said Rostov, \n",
      "‘and here are the provisions.’ \n",
      "‘So they are!’ said the officers. ‘Won’t the soldiers be \n",
      "glad!’ \n",
      "A little behind the hussars came Denisov, accompanied \n",
      "by two infantry officers with whom he was talking. \n",
      "Rostov went to meet them. \n",
      "‘I warn you, Captain,’ one of the officers, a short thin \n",
      "man, evidently very angry, was saying. \n",
      "‘Haven’t I told you I won’ t give them up?’ replied \n",
      "Denisov. War and Peace  \n",
      "922 of 2882 \n",
      "‘You will answer for it, Captain. It is mutiny- seizing \n",
      "the transport of one’s own army. Our men have had \n",
      "nothing to eat for two days.’ \n",
      "‘And mine have had nothing for two weeks,’ said \n",
      "Denisov. \n",
      "‘It is robbery! You’ll answer  for it, sir!’ said the \n",
      "infantry officer, raising his voice. \n",
      "‘Now, what are you pestewing me for?’ cried Denisov, \n",
      "suddenly losing his temper. ‘I shall answer for it and not \n",
      "you, and you’d better not buzz about here till you get hurt. \n",
      "Be off! Go!’ he shouted at the officers. \n",
      "‘Very well, then!’ shouted the little officer, undaunted \n",
      "and not riding away. ‘If you are determined to rob, I’ll..’ \n",
      "‘Go to the devil! quick ma’ch, while you’re safe and \n",
      "sound!’ and Denisov turned his horse on the officer. \n",
      "‘Very well, very well!’ muttered the officer, \n",
      "threateningly, and turning hi s horse he trotted away, \n",
      "jolting in his saddle. \n",
      "‘A dog astwide a fence! A weal dog astwide a fence!’ \n",
      "shouted Denisov after him (the most insulting expression \n",
      "a cavalryman can address to a mounted infantryman) and \n",
      "riding up to Rostov, he burst out laughing. \n",
      "‘I’ve taken twansports from the infantwy by force!’ he \n",
      "said. ‘After all, can’t let our men starve.’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "923 of 2882 \n",
      "The wagons that had reached the hussars had been \n",
      "consigned to an infantry regiment, but learning from \n",
      "Lavrushka that the transport was unescorted, Denisov \n",
      "with his hussars had seized it by force. The soldiers had \n",
      "biscuits dealt out to them freely, and they even shared \n",
      "them with the other squadrons. \n",
      "The next day the regimental commander sent for \n",
      "Denisov, and holding his fingers  spread out before his \n",
      "eyes said: \n",
      "‘This is how I look at this affair: I know nothing about \n",
      "it and won’t begin proceedings, but I advise you to ride \n",
      "over to the staff and settle the business there in the \n",
      "commissariat department and if possible sign a receipt for \n",
      "such and such stores receive d. If not, as the demand was \n",
      "booked against an infantry regiment, there will be a row \n",
      "and the affair may end badly.’ \n",
      "From the regimental commander’s, Denisov rode \n",
      "straight to the staff with a sincere desire to act on this \n",
      "advice. In the evening he cam e back to his dugout in a \n",
      "state such as Rostov had neve r yet seen him in. Denisov \n",
      "could not speak and gasped for breath. When Rostov \n",
      "asked what was the matter, he only uttered some \n",
      "incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse, feeble voice. War and Peace  \n",
      "924 of 2882 \n",
      "Alarmed at Denisov’s condition, Rostov suggested that \n",
      "he should undress, drink some  water, and send for the \n",
      "doctor. \n",
      "‘Twy me for wobbewy... oh! Some more water... Let \n",
      "them twy me, but I’ll always thwash scoundwels... and \n",
      "I’ll tell the Empewo’... Ice...’ he muttered. \n",
      "The regimental doctor, when he came, said it was \n",
      "absolutely necessary to bleed Denisov. A deep saucer of \n",
      "black blood was taken from his hairy arm and only then \n",
      "was he able to relate what had happened to him. \n",
      "‘I get there,’ began Denisov. ‘‘Now then, where’s your \n",
      "chief’s quarters?’ They were pointed out. ‘Please to wait.’ \n",
      "‘I’ve widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to \n",
      "and no time to wait. Announce me.’ Vewy well, so out \n",
      "comes their head chief- also took it into his head to \n",
      "lecture me: ‘It’s wobbewy!’- ‘Wobbewy,’ I say, ‘is not \n",
      "done by man who seizes pwovisi ons to feed his soldiers, \n",
      "but by him who takes them to fill his own pockets!’ ‘Will \n",
      "you please be silent?’ ‘Vewy good!’ Then he says: ‘Go \n",
      "and give a weceipt to the co mmissioner, but your affair \n",
      "will be passed on to headquarters.’ I go to the \n",
      "commissioner. I enter, and at the table... who do you \n",
      "think? No, but wait a bit!... W ho is it that’s starving us?’ \n",
      "shouted Denisov, hitting the table with the fist of his \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "925 of 2882 \n",
      "newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke \n",
      "down and the tumblers on it jumped about. ‘Telyanin! \n",
      "‘What? So it’s you who’s starving us to death! Is it? Take \n",
      "this and this!’ and I hit him so pat, stwaight on his snout... \n",
      "‘Ah, what a... what...!’ and I sta’ted fwashing him... Well, \n",
      "I’ve had a bit of fun I can tell you!’ cried Denisov, gleeful \n",
      "and yet angry, his showing under his black mustache. ‘I’d \n",
      "have killed him if they hadn’t taken him away!’ \n",
      "‘But what are you shouting fo r? Calm yourself,’ said \n",
      "Rostov. ‘You’ve set your arm bleeding afresh. Wait, we \n",
      "must tie it up again.’ \n",
      "Denisov was bandaged up agai n and put to bed. Next \n",
      "day he woke calm and cheerful. \n",
      "But at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into \n",
      "Rostov’s and Denisov’s dugout with a grave and serious \n",
      "face and regretfully showed them a paper addressed to \n",
      "Major Denisov from the regimental commander in which \n",
      "inquiries were made about yesterday’s occurrence. The \n",
      "adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very \n",
      "bad turn: that a court-martial had been appointed, and that \n",
      "in view of the severity with which marauding and \n",
      "insubordination were now rega rded, degradation to the \n",
      "ranks would be the best that could be hoped for. War and Peace  \n",
      "926 of 2882 \n",
      "The case, as represented by the offended parties, was \n",
      "that, after seizing the tran sports, Major Denisov, being \n",
      "drunk, went to the chief quart ermaster and without any \n",
      "provocation called him a thief, threatened to strike him, \n",
      "and on being led out had rushed into the office and given \n",
      "two officials a thrashing, and dislocated the arm of one of \n",
      "them. \n",
      "In answer to Rostov’s renewed questions, Denisov \n",
      "said, laughing, that he thought he remembered that some \n",
      "other fellow had got mixed up in it, but that it was all \n",
      "nonsense and rubbish, and he did not in the least fear any \n",
      "kind of trial, and that if those scoundrels dared attack him \n",
      "he would give them an answer  that they would not easily \n",
      "forget. \n",
      "Denisov spoke contemptuously  of the whole matter, \n",
      "but Rostov knew him too well not to detect that (while \n",
      "hiding it from others) at heart he feared a court-martial \n",
      "and was worried over the affair, which was evidently \n",
      "taking a bad turn. Every day, letters of inquiry and notices \n",
      "from the court arrived, and on the first of May, Denisov \n",
      "was ordered to hand the squadron over to the next in \n",
      "seniority and appear before the staff of his division to \n",
      "explain his violence at the commissariat office. On the \n",
      "previous day Platov reconnoitered with two Cossack \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "927 of 2882 \n",
      "regiments and two squadrons of hussars. Denisov, as was \n",
      "his wont, rode out in front of the outposts, parading his \n",
      "courage. A bullet fired by a French sharpshooter hit him \n",
      "in the fleshy part of his leg. Perhaps at another time \n",
      "Denisov would not have left the regiment for so slight a \n",
      "wound, but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself \n",
      "from appearing at the staff and went into hospital. \n",

      "In June the battle of Friedland was fought, in which the \n",
      "Pavlograds did not take part, and after that an armistice \n",
      "was proclaimed. Rostov, w ho felt his friend’s absence \n",
      "very much, having no news of him since he left and \n",
      "feeling very anxious about hi s wound and the progress of \n",
      "his affairs, took advantage of the armistice to get leave to \n",
      "visit Denisov in hospital. \n",
      "The hospital was in a small Prussian town that had \n",
      "been twice devastated by Russian and French troops. \n",
      "Because it was summer, when it is so beautiful out in the \n",

      "929 of 2882 \n",
      "Directly Rostov entered the door he was enveloped by \n",
      "a smell of putrefaction and hospital air. On the stairs he \n",
      "met a Russian army doctor smoking a cigar. The doctor \n",
      "was followed by a Russian assistant. \n",
      "‘I can’t tear myself to pieces ,’ the doctor was saying. \n",
      "‘Come to Makar Alexeevich in  the evening. I shall be \n",

      "want? The bullets having spar ed you, do you want to try \n",
      "typhus? This is a pesthouse, sir.’ \n",
      "‘How so?’ asked Rostov. \n",
      "‘Typhus, sir. It’s death to go in. Only we two, Makeev \n",
      "and I’ (he pointed to the assistant), ‘keep on here. Some \n",
      "five of us doctors have died  in this place.... When a new \n",
      "one comes he is done for in a week,’ said the doctor with \n",
      "evident satisfaction. ‘Prussian doctors have been invited \n",
      "here, but our allies don’t like it at all.’ \n",
      "Rostov explained that he wa nted to see Major Denisov \n",
      "of the hussars, who was wounded. \n",
      "‘I don’t know. I can’t tell you, sir. Only think! I am \n",
      "alone in charge of three hospi tals with more than four War and Peace  \n",

      "sir, and they’re always sendi ng me fresh ones. There are \n",
      "four hundred? Eh?’ he asked, turning to the assistant. \n",
      "The assistant looked fagged out. He was evidently \n",
      "vexed and impatient for the talkative doctor to go. \n",
      "‘Major Denisov,’ Rostov said again. ‘He was wounded \n",
      "at Molliten.’ \n",
      "‘Dead, I fancy. Eh, Makeev?’ queried the doctor, in a \n",
      "tone of indifference. \n",
      "The assistant, however, did not confirm the doctor’s \n",
      "words. \n",
      "‘Is he tall and with reddish hair?’ asked the doctor. \n",
      "Rostov described Denisov’s appearance. \n",

      "‘That one is dead, I fancy. Ho wever, I’ll look up our list. \n",
      "We had a list. Have you got it, Makeev?’ \n",
      "‘Makar Alexeevich has the list,’ answered the \n",

      "see for yourself,’ he added, turning to Rostov. \n",
      "‘Ah, you’d better not go, sir,’ said the doctor, ‘or you \n",
      "may have to stay here yourself.’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "931 of 2882 \n",
      "But Rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and \n",
      "asked the assistant to show him the way. \n",
      "‘Only don’t blame me!’ the doctor shouted up after \n",
      "him. \n",
      "Rostov and the assistant went  into the dark corridor. \n",
      "The smell was so strong there that Rostov held his nose \n",
      "and had to pause and collect his strength before he could \n",
      "go on. A door opened to the right, and an emaciated \n",
      "sallow man on crutches, barefoot and in underclothing, \n",
      "limped out and, leaning agains t the doorpost, looked with \n",
      "glittering envious eyes at  those who were passing. \n",
      "Glancing in at the door, Rostov saw that the sick and \n",
      "wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoats. \n",
      "‘May I go in and look?’ \n",
      "‘What is there to see?’ said the assistant. \n",
      "But, just because the assistant evidently did not want \n",
      "him to go in, Rostov entered th e soldiers’ ward. The foul \n",
      "air, to which he had alrea dy begun to get used in the \n",
      "corridor, was still stronger he re. It was a little different, \n",
      "more pungent, and one felt that this was where it \n",
      "originated. \n",
      "In the long room, brightly li t up by the sun through the \n",
      "large windows, the sick and wounded lay in two rows \n",
      "with their heads to the walls, and leaving a passage in the War and Peace  \n",
      "932 of 2882 \n",
      "middle. Most of them were unconscious and paid no \n",
      "attention to the newcomers. Those who were conscious \n",
      "raised themselves or lifted th eir thin yellow faces, and all \n",
      "looked intently at Rostov w ith the same expression of \n",
      "hope, of relief, reproach, and envy of another’s health. \n",
      "Rostov went to the middle of the room and looking \n",
      "through the open doors into th e two adjoining rooms saw \n",
      "the same thing there. He stood still, looking silently \n",
      "around. He had not at all expected such a sight. Just \n",
      "before him, almost across the middle of the passage on \n",
      "the bare floor, lay a sick man, probably a Cossack to \n",
      "judge by the cut of his hair. The man lay on his back, his \n",
      "huge arms and legs outstretched. His face was purple, his \n",
      "eyes were rolled back so that only the whites were seen, \n",
      "and on his bare legs and arms  which were still red, the \n",
      "veins stood out like cords. He was knocking the back of \n",
      "his head against the floor, hoarsely uttering some word \n",
      "which he kept repeating. Rostov listened and made out the \n",
      "word. It was ‘drink, drink, a drink!’ Rostov glanced \n",
      "round, looking for someone who would put this man back \n",
      "in his place and bring him water. \n",
      "‘Who looks after the sick here?’ he asked the assistant. \n",

      "933 of 2882 \n",
      "Just then a commissariat soldier, a hospital orderly, \n",
      "came in from the next room, marching stiffly, and drew \n",
      "up in front of Rostov. \n",
      "‘Good day, your honor!’ he shouted, rolling his eyes at \n",
      "Rostov and evidently mistaking him for one of the \n",
      "hospital authorities. \n",
      "‘Get him to his place and give him some water,’ said \n",
      "Rostov, pointing to the Cossack. \n",
      "‘Yes, your honor,’ the soldier replied complacently, \n",
      "and rolling his eyes more th an ever he drew himself up \n",
      "still straighter, but did not move. \n",
      "‘No, it’s impossible to do anything here,’ thought \n",
      "Rostov, lowering his eyes, and he was going out, but \n",
      "became aware of an intense look fixed on him on his \n",
      "right, and he turned. Close to  the corner, on an overcoat, \n",
      "sat an old, unshaven, gray-beard ed soldier as thin as a \n",
      "skeleton, with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed \n",
      "on Rostov. The man’s neighbor on one side whispered \n",
      "something to him, pointing at Rostov, who noticed that \n",
      "the old man wanted to speak to him. He drew nearer and \n",
      "saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him, the \n",
      "other had been amputated above the knee. His neighbor \n",
      "on the other side, who lay motionless some distance from \n",
      "him with his head thrown back, was a young soldier with War and Peace  \n",
      "934 of 2882 \n",
      "a snub nose. His pale waxen face was still freckled and \n",
      "his eyes were rolled bac k. Rostov looked at the young \n",
      "soldier and a cold chill ran down his back. \n",
      "‘Why, this one seems...’ he began, turning to the \n",
      "assistant. \n",
      "‘And how we’ve been begging, your honor,’ said the \n",
      "old soldier, his jaw quiveri ng. ‘He’s been dead since \n",

      "‘I’ll send someone at once. He shall be taken away- \n",
      "taken away at once,’ said the assistant hurriedly. ‘Let us \n",
      "go, your honor.’ \n",
      "‘Yes, yes, let us go,’ said Rostov hastily, and lowering \n",
      "his eyes and shrinking, he tried to pass unnoticed between \n",
      "the rows of reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon \n",
      "him, and went out of the room. \n",

      "Going along the corridor, th e assistant led Rostov to \n",
      "the officers’ wards, consisting of three rooms, the doors \n",
      "of which stood open. There were  beds in these rooms and \n",
      "the sick and wounded officers were lying or sitting on \n",
      "them. Some were walking a bout the rooms in hospital \n",
      "dressing gowns. The first person Rostov met in the \n",
      "officers’ ward was a thin little man with one arm, who \n",
      "was walking about the first room in a nightcap and \n",
      "hospital dressing gown, with a pipe between his teeth. \n",
      "Rostov looked at him, trying to remember where he had \n",

      "‘Tushin, Tushin, don’t you remember, who gave you a lift \n",
      "at Schon Grabern? And I’ve had a bit cut off, you see...’ \n",
      "he went on with a smile, pointing to the empty sleeve of \n",
      "his dressing gown. ‘Looking for Vasili Dmitrich Denisov? \n",
      "My neighbor,’ he added, when he heard who Rostov \n",
      "wanted. ‘Here, here,’ and Tushin led him into the next \n",

      "voices. War and Peace  \n",
      "936 of 2882 \n",
      "‘How can they laugh, or even live at all here?’ thought \n",
      "Rostov, still aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that \n",
      "had been so strong in the soldiers’ ward, and still seeming \n",
      "to see fixed on him those envious looks which had \n",
      "followed him out from both si des, and the face of that \n",

      "out, still in the same voice as in the regiment, but Rostov \n",

      "some new, sinister, hidden feeling showed itself in the \n",
      "expression of Denisov’s face and the intonations of his \n",
      "voice. \n",
      "His wound, though a slight one, had not yet healed \n",
      "even now, six weeks after he had been hit. His face had \n",
      "the same swollen pallor as the faces of the other hospital \n",
      "patients, but it was not this  that struck Rostov. What \n",
      "struck him was that Denisov did not seem glad to see him, \n",
      "and smiled at him unnaturally. He did not ask about the \n",
      "regiment, nor about the general state of affairs, and when \n",
      "Rostov spoke of these matters did not listen. \n",
      "Rostov even noticed that Denisov did not like to be \n",
      "reminded of the regiment, or in general of that other free \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "937 of 2882 \n",
      "life which was going on outside  the hospital. He seemed \n",
      "to try to forget that old life and was only interested in the \n",
      "affair with the commissariat officers. On Rostov’s inquiry \n",
      "as to how the matter stood, he at once produced from \n",
      "under his pillow a paper he had received from the \n",
      "commission and the rough draft of his answer to it. He \n",

      "939 of 2882 \n",
      "Tushin and the other officer s was the safest, and though \n",

      "941 of 2882 \n",
      "with monograms, saw Napoleon pass before the French \n",

      "other facts he felt to be of historic importance. As the \n",
      "Emperor’s suite was a very small one, it was a matter of \n",
      "great importance, for a man who valued his success in the \n",

      "between the two Emperors, and having succeeded in this, \n",

      "Rostov, in common with the whole army from which \n",

      "feeling toward Napoleon and the French- who from being \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "943 of 2882 \n",
      "foes had suddenly become friends- that had taken place at \n",
      "headquarters and in Boris. In the army, Bonaparte and the \n",
      "French were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger, \n",
      "contempt, and fear. Only recently, talking with one of \n",
      "Platov’s Cossack officers, Rostov had argued that if \n",
      "Napoleon were taken prisoner he  would be treated not as \n",
      "a sovereign, but as a criminal . Quite lately, happening to \n",
      "meet a wounded French col onel on the road, Rostov had \n",
      "maintained with heat that peace was impossible between a \n",
      "legitimate sovereign and the criminal Bonaparte. Rostov \n",
      "was therefore unpleasantly st ruck by the presence of \n",
      "French officers in Boris’ lodging, dressed in uniforms he \n",
      "had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of \n",
      "view from the outposts of the flank. As soon as he noticed \n",
      "a French officer, who thrust hi s head out of the door, that \n",
      "warlike feeling of hostility wh ich he always experienced \n",
      "at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him. He stopped \n",
      "at the threshold and asked in Russian whether Drubetskoy \n",
      "lived there. Boris, hearing a strange voice in the \n",
      "anteroom, came out to meet him. An expression of \n",
      "annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face on first \n",
      "recognizing Rostov. War and Peace  \n",
      "944 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Ah, it’s you? Very glad, very glad to see you,’ he said, \n",
      "however, coming toward him with a smile. But Rostov \n",
      "had noticed his first impulse. \n",
      "‘I’ve come at a bad time I think. I should not have \n",
      "come, but I have business,’ he said coldly. \n",
      "‘No, I only wonder how you managed to get away \n",
      "from your regiment. Dans un moment je suis a vous,’* he \n",

      "*\"In a minute I shall be at your disposal.’ \n",
      "‘I see I’m intruding,’ Rostov repeated. \n",
      "The look of annoyance had already disappeared from \n",
      "Boris’ face: having evidently reflected and decided how \n",
      "to act, he very quietly t ook both Rostov’s hands and led \n",
      "him into the next room. His eyes, looking serenely and \n",
      "steadily at Rostov, seemed to be veiled by something, as \n",
      "if screened by blue spectacles  of conventionality. So it \n",
      "seemed to Rostov. \n",
      "‘Oh, come now! As if you could come at a wrong \n",
      "time!’ said Boris, and he led him into the room where the \n",
      "supper table was laid and in troduced him to his guests, \n",

      "Zhilinski evidently did not receive this new Russian \n",
      "person very willingly into his circle and did not speak to \n",

      "composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with \n",
      "which he had met Rostov, tried to enliven the \n",

      "always happens to those in a bad humor, it seemed to him \n",
      "that everyone regarded him with aversion and that he was \n",
      "in everybody’s way. He really  was in their way, for he \n",
      "alone took no part in th e conversation which again \n",
      "became general. The looks the visitors cast on him \n",
      "seemed to say: ‘And what is he sitting here for?’ He rose \n",

      "petition on Denisov’s behalf. He could not himself go to \n",
      "the general in attendance as he was in mufti and had come \n",
      "to Tilsit without permission to do so, and Boris, even had \n",
      "he wished to, could not have done so on the following \n",
      "day. On that day, June 27, the preliminaries of peace were \n",
      "signed. The Emperors exchanged decorations: Alexander \n",
      "received the Cross of the Le gion of Honor and Napoleon \n",
      "the Order of St. Andrew of the First Degree, and a dinner \n",
      "had been arranged for the evening, given by a battalion of \n",
      "the French Guards to the Preobrazhensk battalion. The \n",
      "Emperors were to be present at that banquet. War and Peace  \n",
      "948 of 2882 \n",
      "Rostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with Boris \n",
      "that, when the latter looked in after supper, he pretended \n",
      "to be asleep, and early next morning went away, avoiding \n",
      "Boris. In his civilian clothes and a round hat, he wandered \n",
      "about the town, staring at th e French and their uniforms \n",
      "and at the streets and houses where the Russian and \n",
      "French Emperors were staying. In a square he saw tables \n",
      "being set up and preparations made for the dinner; he saw \n",
      "the Russian and French colors draped from side to side of \n",
      "the streets, with hugh m onograms A and N. In the \n",
      "windows of the houses also flags and bunting were \n",
      "displayed. \n",
      "‘Boris doesn’t want to help me and I don’t want to ask \n",
      "him. That’s settled,’ thought Nicholas. ‘All is over \n",
      "between us, but I won’t leave here without having done \n",
      "all I can for Denisov and certainly not without getting his \n",
      "letter to the Emperor. Th e Emperor!... He is here!’ \n",
      "thought Rostov, who had unconsciously returned to the \n",
      "house where Alexander lodged. \n",
      "Saddled horses were standing before the house and the \n",
      "suite were assembling, evidently preparing for the \n",
      "Emperor to come out. \n",
      "‘I may see him at any mome nt,’ thought Rostov. ‘If \n",
      "only I were to hand the letter direct to him and tell him \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "949 of 2882 \n",
      "all... could they really arrest me for my civilian clothes? \n",
      "Surely not! He would understa nd on whose side justice \n",
      "lies. He understands everyt hing, knows everything. Who \n",
      "can be more just, more magnanimous than he? And even \n",
      "if they did arrest me for being here, what would it \n",
      "matter?’ thought he, looking at an officer who was \n",
      "entering the house the Empero r occupied. ‘After all, \n",
      "people do go in.... It’s all nonsense! I’ll go in and hand the \n",
      "letter to the Emperor myself so much the worse for \n",
      "Drubetskoy who drives me to it!’ And suddenly with a \n",
      "determination he himself did not expect, Rostov felt for \n",
      "the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house. \n",
      "‘No, I won’t miss my opportunity now, as I did after \n",
      "Austerlitz,’ he thought, expect ing every moment to meet \n",
      "the monarch, and conscious of the blood that rushed to his \n",
      "heart at the thought. ‘I will fall at his feet and beseech \n",
      "him. He will lift me up, will listen, and will even thank \n",
      "me. ‘I am happy when I can do good, but to remedy \n",
      "injustice is the greatest ha ppiness,’’ Rostov fancied the \n",
      "sovereign saying. And passing people who looked after \n",
      "him with curiosity, he entere d the porch of the Emperor’s \n",
      "house. War and Peace  \n",
      "950 of 2882 \n",
      "A broad staircase led straight  up from the entry, and to \n",
      "the right he saw a closed door. Below, under the staircase, \n",
      "was a door leading to the lower floor. \n",
      "‘Whom do you want?’ someone inquired. \n",
      "‘To hand in a letter, a peti tion, to His Majesty,’ said \n",
      "Nicholas, with a tremor in his voice. \n",
      "‘A petition? This way, to the officer the officer on \n",
      "duty’ (he was shown the door leading downstairs), ‘only it \n",
      "won’t be accepted.’ \n",
      "On hearing this indiffer ent voice, Rostov grew \n",
      "frightened at what he was doing; the thought of meeting \n",
      "the Emperor at any moment was so fascinating and \n",
      "consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away, \n",
      "but the official who had que stioned him opened the door, \n",
      "and Rostov entered. \n",
      "A short stout man of about thirty, in white breeches \n",
      "and high boots and a batiste shirt that he had evidently \n",
      "only just put on, standing in that room, and his valet was \n",
      "buttoning on to the back of his breeches a new pair of \n",
      "handsome silk-embroidered braces that, for some reason, \n",
      "attracted Rostov’s attention. This man was was speaking \n",
      "to someone in the adjoining room. \n",
      "‘A good figure and in her first bloom,’ he was saying, \n",
      "but on seeing Rostov, he stopped short and frowned. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "951 of 2882 \n",
      "‘What is it? A petition?’ \n",
      "‘What is it?’ asked the person in the other room. \n",
      "‘Another petitioner,’ answ ered the man with the \n",

      "‘Tell him to come later. He’ll be coming out directly, \n",
      "we must go.’ \n",
      "‘Later... later! Tomorrow. It’s too late..’ \n",
      "Rostov turned and was about to go, but the man in the \n",
      "braces stopped him. \n",
      "‘Whom have you come from? Who are you?’ \n",
      "‘I come from Major Denisov,’ answered Rostov. \n",

      "‘Lieutenant Count Rostov.’ \n",
      "‘What audacity! Hand it in through your commander. \n",
      "And go along with you... go,’ and he continued to put on \n",
      "the uniform the valet handed him. \n",
      "Rostov went back into the hall and noticed that in the \n",
      "porch there were many officers and generals in full parade \n",
      "uniform, whom he had to pass. \n",
      "Cursing his temerity, his heart sinking at the thought of \n",
      "finding himself at any moment  face to face with the \n",
      "Emperor and being put to sh ame and arrested in his \n",
      "presence, fully alive now to the impropriety of his \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "952 of 2882 \n",
      "was making his way out of th e house through the brilliant \n",
      "suite when a familiar voice called him and a hand \n",
      "detained him. \n",
      "‘What are you doing here, sir, in civilian dress?’ asked \n",
      "a deep voice. \n",
      "It was a cavalry general who had obtained the \n",
      "Emperor’s special favor during this campaign, and who \n",
      "had formerly commanded the division in which Rostov \n",
      "was serving. \n",
      "Rostov, in dismay, began justifying himself, but seeing \n",
      "the kindly, jocular face of the general, he took him aside \n",
      "and in an excited voice told him the whole affair, asking \n",
      "him to intercede for Denisov, whom the general knew. \n",
      "Having heard Rostov to the end, the general shook his \n",
      "head gravely. \n",
      "‘I’m sorry, sorry for that fine fellow. Give me the \n",
      "letter.’ \n",
      "Hardly had Rostov handed him the letter and finished \n",
      "explaining Denisov’s case, when hasty steps and the \n",
      "jingling of spurs were heard on the stairs, and the general, \n",
      "leaving him, went to the porch. The gentlemen of the \n",
      "Emperor’s suite ran down the stairs and went to their \n",
      "horses. Hayne, the same groom who had been at \n",
      "Austerlitz, led up the Emperor’s horse, and the faint creak \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "953 of 2882 \n",
      "of a footstep Rostov knew at once was heard on the stairs. \n",
      "Forgetting the danger of be ing recognized, Rostov went \n",
      "close to the porch, together  with some inquisitive \n",
      "civilians, and again, after two years, saw those features he \n",
      "adored: that same face and same look and step, and the \n",
      "same union of majesty and m ildness.... And the feeling of \n",
      "enthusiasm and love for hi s sovereign rose again in \n",
      "Rostov’s soul in all its old force. In the uniform of the \n",
      "Preobrazhensk regiment- white chamois-leather breeches \n",
      "and high boots- and wearing a star Rostov did not know \n",
      "(it was that of the Legion d’honneur), the monarch came \n",
      "out into the porch, putting on his gloves and carrying his \n",
      "hat under his arm. He stopped and looked about him, \n",
      "brightening everything around by his glance. He spoke a \n",
      "few words to some of the generals, and, recognizing the \n",
      "former commander of Rostov’s division, smiled and \n",
      "beckoned to him. \n",
      "All the suite drew back and Rostov saw the general \n",
      "talking for some time to the Emperor. \n",
      "The Emperor said a few words to him and took a step \n",
      "toward his horse. Again the crowd of members of the \n",
      "suite and street gazers (am ong whom was Rostov) moved \n",
      "nearer to the Emperor. Stopping beside his horse, with his \n",
      "hand on the saddle, the Empero r turned to the cavalry War and Peace  \n",
      "954 of 2882 \n",
      "general and said in a loud voi ce, evidently wi shing to be \n",
      "heard by all: \n",
      "‘I cannot do it, General. I cannot, because the law is \n",
      "stronger than I,’ and he raised his foot to the stirrup. \n",
      "The general bowed his head respectfully, and the \n",
      "monarch mounted and rode dow n the street at a gallop. \n",
      "Beside himself with enthusiasm, Rostov ran after him \n",

      "Chapter XXI \n",
      "The Emperor rode to the square where, facing one \n",
      "another, a battalion of the Preobrazhensk regiment stood \n",
      "on the right and a battalion of the French Guards in their \n",
      "bearskin caps on the left. \n",
      "As the Tsar rode up to one  flank of the battalions, \n",
      "which presented arms, a nother group of horsemen \n",
      "galloped up to the opposite flank, and at the head of them \n",
      "Rostov recognized Napoleon. It could be no one else. He \n",
      "came at a gallop, wearing a sm all hat, a blue uniform \n",
      "open over a white vest, and the St. Andrew ribbon over \n",
      "his shoulder. He was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray \n",
      "Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered saddlecloth. \n",
      "On approaching Alexander he raised his hat, and as he did \n",
      "so, Rostov, with his cavalryman’s eye, could not help \n",
      "noticing that Napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the \n",
      "saddle. The battalions s houted ‘Hurrah!’ and ‘Vive \n",

      "both Emperors dismounted and took each other’s hands. \n",
      "Napoleon’s face wore an unpl easant and artificial smile. \n",
      "Alexander was saying something affable to him. War and Peace  \n",
      "956 of 2882 \n",
      "In spite of the trampling of the French gendarmes’ \n",
      "horses, which were pushing back the crowd, Rostov kept \n",
      "his eyes on every movement of Alexander and Bonaparte. \n",
      "It struck him as a surprise that Alexander treated \n",
      "Bonaparte as an equal and that  the latter was quite at ease \n",
      "with the Tsar, as if such re lations with an Emperor were \n",
      "an everyday matter to him. \n",
      "Alexander and Napoleon, with the long train of their \n",

      "afraid he might be recognized. \n",
      "‘Sire, I ask your permission to present the Legion of \n",
      "Honor to the bravest of your  soldiers,’ said a sharp, \n",
      "precise voice, articulating every letter. \n",
      "This was said by the unders ized Napoleon, looking up \n",

      "‘Can it be me?’ thought Rostov. \n",

      "Napoleon slightly turned his head, and put his plump \n",
      "little hand out behind him as if to take something. The \n",
      "members of his suite, guessing at once what he wanted, \n",
      "moved about and whispered as they passed something \n",
      "from one to another, and a page- the same one Rostov had \n",

      "bowing respectfully over the outstretched hand and not \n",
      "keeping it waiting a moment, la id in it an Order on a red \n",
      "ribbon. Napoleon, without looking, pressed two fingers \n",
      "together and the badge was between them. Then he \n",
      "approached Lazarev (who rolle d his eyes and persistently \n",
      "gazed at his own monarch), looked round at the Emperor \n",
      "Alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done \n",
      "for the sake of his ally, and the small white hand holding \n",

      "deign to touch that soldier’s breast for the soldier to be \n",
      "forever happy, rewarded, and distinguished from \n",
      "everyone else in the world. Napoleon merely laid the \n",

      "to see him. A rumble of Russian and French voices and \n",
      "laughter filled the air round th e tables in the square. Two \n",
      "officers with flushed faces, looking cheerful and happy, \n",
      "passed by Rostov. \n",

      "‘Yes, I will.’ \n",
      "Rostov stood at that corner for a long time, watching \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "961 of 2882 \n",
      "process was going on which he  could not bring to a \n",
      "conclusion. Terrible doubts ro se in his soul. Now he \n",
      "remembered Denisov with his changed expression, his \n",
      "submission, and the whole hosp ital, with arms and legs \n",
      "torn off and its dirt and dise ase. So vividly did he recall \n",
      "that hospital stench of dead  flesh that he looked round to \n",
      "see where the smell came from. Next he thought of that \n",
      "self-satisfied Bonaparte, w ith his small white hand, who \n",
      "was now an Emperor, liked and respected by Alexander. \n",
      "Then why those severed arms and legs and those dead \n",
      "men?... Then again he thought of Lazarev rewarded and \n",
      "Denisov punished and unpardoned. He caught himself \n",
      "harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened. \n",
      "The smell of the food the Pr eobrazhenskis were eating \n",
      "and a sense of hunger recalled him from these reflections; \n",
      "he had to get something to eat before going away. He \n",
      "went to a hotel he had noticed that morning. There he \n",
      "found so many people, among them officers who, like \n",
      "himself, had come in civilian clothes, that he had \n",
      "difficulty in getting a dinne r. Two officers of his own \n",
      "division joined him. The conve rsation naturally turned on \n",
      "the peace. The officers, his comrades, like most of the \n",
      "army, were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the \n",
      "battle of Friedland. They said that had we held out a little War and Peace  \n",
      "962 of 2882 \n",
      "longer Napoleon would have been  done for, as his troops \n",
      "had neither provisions nor am munition. Nicholas ate and \n",
      "drank (chiefly the latter) in silence. He finished a couple \n",
      "of bottles of wine by himself. The process in his mind \n",
      "went on tormenting him without reaching a conclusion. \n",
      "He feared to give way to hi s thoughts, yet could not get \n",
      "rid of them. Suddenly, on one of  the officers’ saying that \n",
      "it was humiliating to look at the French, Rostov began \n",
      "shouting with uncalled-for wrath, and therefore much to \n",
      "the surprise of the officers: \n",
      "‘How can you judge what’s best?’ he cried, the blood \n",
      "suddenly rushing to his face. ‘How can you judge the \n",
      "Emperor’s actions? What righ t have we to argue? We \n",
      "cannot comprehend either the Emperor’s or his actions!’ \n",
      "‘But I never said a word about the Emperor!’ said the \n",
      "officer, justifying himself, and unable to understand \n",

      "drunk. \n",
      "But Rostov did not listen to him. \n",

      "motionless, and lilac-colored flowers and the first blades \n",
      "of green grass were pushing up and lifting last year’s \n",
      "leaves. The coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees \n",
      "scattered here and there among the birches was an \n",

      "enormous tree, its girth twice as great as a man could \n",
      "embrace, and evidently long ago some of its branches had \n",
      "been broken off and its ba rk scarred. With its huge \n",
      "ungainly limbs sprawling unsymmetrically, and its \n",
      "gnarled hands and fingers, it stood an aged, stern, and \n",

      "this oak, refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice \n",
      "either the spring or the sunshine. \n",

      "A whole sequence of new thoughts, hopeless but \n",
      "mournfully pleasant, rose in his soul in connection with \n",

      "day was so beautiful, the s un so bright, everything around War and Peace  \n",
      "972 of 2882 \n",
      "so gay, but that slim pretty girl did not know , or wish to \n",

      "life. ‘What is she so glad about? What is she thinking of? \n",
      "Not of the military regulations or of the arrangement of \n",

      "instinctive curiosity. \n",
      "In 1809 Count Ilya Rostov was living at Otradnoe just \n",
      "as he had done in former years, that is, entertaining almost \n",
      "the whole province with hunts, theatricals, dinners, and \n",
      "music. He was glad to see Prince Andrew, as he was to \n",
      "see any new visitor, and insisted on his staying the night. \n",
      "During the dull day, in the course of which he was \n",
      "entertained by his elderly hosts and by the more important \n",
      "of the visitors (the old count’s house was crowded on \n",
      "account of an approaching na me day), Prince Andrew \n",
      "repeatedly glanced at Nata sha, gay and laughing among \n",
      "the younger members of the company, and asked himself \n",
      "each time, ‘What is she thinking about? Why is she so \n",
      "glad?’ \n",
      "That night, alone in ne w surroundings, he was long \n",
      "unable to sleep. He read awhile and then put out his \n",
      "candle, but relit it. It was hot in the room, the inside \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "973 of 2882 \n",
      "shutters of which were clos ed. He was cross with the \n",
      "stupid old man (as he called Rostov), who had made him \n",
      "stay by assuring him that some necessary documents had \n",
      "not yet arrived from town, and he was vexed with himself \n",
      "for having stayed. \n",
      "He got up and went to the window to open it. As soon \n",
      "as he opened the shutters the moonlight, as if it had long \n",
      "been watching for this, burst into the room. He opened the \n",
      "casement. The night was fresh, bright, and very still. Just \n",
      "before the window was a row of pollard trees, looking \n",
      "black on one side and with a silvery light on the other. \n",
      "Beneath the trees grewsome kind of lush, wet, bushy \n",
      "vegetation with silver-lit leaves  and stems here and there. \n",
      "Farther back beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with \n",
      "dew, to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly white \n",
      "trunk and branches, and above it shone the moon, nearly \n",
      "at its full, in a pale, almost starless, spring sky. Prince \n",
      "Andrew leaned his elbows on the window ledge and his \n",
      "eyes rested on that sky. \n",
      "His room was on the first floor. Those in the rooms \n",
      "above were also awake. He heard female voices overhead. \n",
      "‘Just once more,’ said a girlish voice above him which \n",
      "Prince Andrew recognized at once. War and Peace  \n",
      "974 of 2882 \n",
      "‘But when are you coming to  bed?’ replied another \n",
      "voice. \n",
      "‘I won’t, I can’t sleep, what’s the use? Come now for \n",
      "the last time.’ \n",
      "Two girlish voices sang a mu sical passage- the end of \n",
      "some song. \n",
      "‘Oh, how lovely! Now go to sleep, and there’s an end \n",
      "of it.’ \n",
      "‘You go to sleep, but I can’t,’ said the first voice, \n",
      "coming nearer to the window. She was evidently leaning \n",
      "right out, for the rustle of her dress and even her breathing \n",
      "could be heard. Everything wa s stone-still, like the moon \n",
      "and its light and the shadows.  Prince Andrew, too, dared \n",
      "not stir, for fear of betraying his unintentional presence. \n",
      "‘Sonya! Sonya!’ he again heard the first speaker. ‘Oh, \n",
      "how can you sleep? Only look how glorious it is! Ah, how \n",
      "glorious! Do wake up, Sonya!’ she said almost with tears \n",
      "in her voice. ‘There never, never was such a lovely night \n",
      "before!’ \n",

      "‘Do just come and see what a moon!... Oh, how lovely! \n",
      "Come here.... Darling, sweethear t, come here! There, you \n",
      "see? I feel like sitting down on my heels, putting my arms \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "975 of 2882 \n",
      "round my knees like this, stra ining tight, as tight as \n",
      "possible, and flying away! Like this...’ \n",
      "‘Take care, you’ll fall out.’ \n",
      "He heard the sound of a scuffle and Sonya’s \n",
      "disapproving voice: ‘It’s past one o’clock.’ \n",
      "‘Oh, you only spoil things for me. All right, go, go!’ \n",
      "Again all was silent, but Prince Andrew knew she was \n",
      "still sitting there. From time to time he heard a soft rustle \n",
      "and at times a sigh. \n",
      "‘O God, O God! What does it mean?’ she suddenly \n",
      "exclaimed. ‘To bed then, if it must be!’ and she slammed \n",
      "the casement. \n",
      "‘For her I might as well not exist!’ thought Prince \n",
      "Andrew while he listened to her voice, for some reason \n",
      "expecting yet fearing that she might say something about \n",
      "him. ‘There she is again! As if it were on purpose,’ \n",
      "thought he. \n",
      "In his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected \n",
      "turmoil of youthful thoughts a nd hopes, contrary to the \n",
      "whole tenor of his life, th at unable to explain his \n",

      "Next morning, having taken leave of no one but the \n",

      "Andrew set off for home. \n",
      "It was already the beginning of June when on his \n",
      "return journey he drove into  the birch forest where the \n",
      "gnarled old oak had made so  strange and memorable an \n",
      "impression on him. In the forest the harness bells sounded \n",
      "yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before, \n",
      "for now all was thick, sh ady, and dense, and the young \n",
      "firs dotted about in the fore st did not jar on the general \n",
      "beauty but, lending themselves  to the mood around, were \n",
      "delicately green with fluffy young shoots. \n",
      "The whole day had been hot. Somewhere a storm was \n",
      "gathering, but only a small cloud had scattered some \n",
      "raindrops lightly, sprinkli ng the road and the sappy \n",
      "leaves. The left side of the fo rest was dark in the shade, \n",
      "the right side glittered in th e sunlight, wet and shiny and \n",
      "scarcely swayed by the breeze. Everything was in \n",
      "blossom, the nightingales trilled, and their voices \n",
      "reverberated now near, now far away. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "977 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Yes, here in this forest was that oak with which I \n",
      "agreed,’ thought Prince Andr ew. ‘But where is it?’ he \n",
      "again wondered, gazing at the left side of the road, and \n",
      "without recognizing it he l ooked with admiration at the \n",
      "very oak he sought. The old oak, quite transfigured, \n",
      "spreading out a canopy of sappy dark-green foliage, stood \n",
      "rapt and slightly trembling in the rays of th e evening sun. \n",
      "Neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and \n",
      "sorrows were any of them in evidence now. Through the \n",
      "hard century-old bark, even where there were no twigs, \n",
      "leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the \n",
      "old veteran could have produced. \n",
      "‘Yes, it is the same oak,’ thought Prince Andrew, and \n",
      "all at once he was seized by an unreasoning springtime \n",
      "feeling of joy and renewal. All the best moments of his \n",
      "life suddenly rose to his memory. Austerlitz with the lofty \n",
      "heavens, his wife’s dead reproachful face, Pierre at the \n",
      "ferry, that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night, and that \n",
      "night itself and the moon, and.... all this rushed suddenly \n",
      "to his mind. \n",
      "‘No, life is not over at thirty-one!’ Prince Andrew \n",
      "suddenly decided finally and decisively. ‘It is not enough \n",
      "for me to know what I have in me- everyone must know \n",
      "it: Pierre, and that young girl who wanted to fly away into War and Peace  \n",
      "978 of 2882 \n",
      "the sky, everyone must know me, so that my life may not \n",
      "be lived for myself alone while others live so apart from \n",
      "it, but so that it may be reflected in them all, and they and \n",
      "I may live in harmony!’ \n",
      "On reaching home Prince Andrew decided to go to \n",
      "Petersburg that autumn and found all sorts of reasons for \n",
      "this decision. A whole serics  of sensible and logical \n",
      "considerations showing it to be  essential for him to go to \n",
      "Petersburg, and even to re-enter the service, kept \n",
      "springing up in his mind. He could not now understand \n",
      "how he could ever even have  doubted the necessity of \n",
      "taking an active share in life, just as a month before he \n",
      "had not understood how the id ea of leaving the quiet \n",
      "country could ever enter his h ead. It now seemed clear to \n",
      "him that all his experience of  life must be senselessly \n",
      "wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and \n",
      "again played an active part in life. He did not even \n",
      "remember how formerly, on the strength of similar \n",
      "wretched logical arguments, it had seemed obvious that \n",
      "he would be degrading himself if he now, after the lessons \n",
      "he had had in life, allowed himself to believe in the \n",
      "possibility of being useful and in the possibility of \n",
      "happiness or love. Now reas on suggested quite the \n",
      "opposite. After that journey to Ryazan he found the \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "979 of 2882 \n",
      "country dull; his former pursuits no longer interested him, \n",
      "and often when sitting alone in his study he got up, went \n",
      "to the mirror, and gazed a long time at his own face. Then \n",
      "he would turn away to the portrait of his dead Lise, who \n",
      "with hair curled a la grecque  looked tenderly and gaily at \n",
      "him out of the gilt frame. She did not now say those \n",
      "former terrible words to him, but looked simply, merrily, \n",
      "and inquisitively at him. And Prince Andrew, crossing his \n",
      "arms behind him, long paced the room, now frowning, \n",
      "now smiling, as he reflected on those irrational, \n",

      "cold, repellent glance the Emperor gave him, he now \n",

      "at once, and felt a throb within him, as happens at critical \n",
      "moments of life. Whether it was from respect, envy, or \n",
      "anticipation, he did not know . Speranski’s whole figure \n",

      "In the society in which Prince Andrew lived he had never \n",
      "seen anyone who together with awkward and clumsy \n",
      "gestures possessed such calmness and self-assurance; he \n",
      "had never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "991 of 2882 \n",
      "in those half-closed, rather humid eyes, or so firm a smile \n",
      "that expressed nothing; nor ha d he heard such a refined, \n",
      "smooth, soft voice; above all he had never seen such \n",
      "delicate whiteness of face or hands- hands which were \n",
      "broad, but very plump, soft , and white. Such whiteness \n",
      "and softness Prince Andrew had only seen on the faces of \n",
      "soldiers who had been long in hospital. This was \n",
      "Speranski, Secretary of State, reporter to the Emperor and \n",

      "Speranski did not shift his eyes from one face to \n",
      "another as people involuntarily do on entering a large \n",
      "company and was in no hurry to speak. He spoke slowly, \n",
      "with assurance that he would be listened to, and he looked \n",
      "only at the person with whom he was conversing. \n",
      "Prince Andrew followed Speranski’s every word and \n",

      "‘I am very glad to make your acquaintance. I had heard \n",
      "of you, as everyone has,’ he said after a pause. \n",

      "long since an insignificant divinity student, who now, \n",
      "Bolkonski thought, held in his hands- those plump white \n",
      "hands- the fate of Russia. Prince Andrew was struck by \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "993 of 2882 \n",
      "the extraordinarily disdainful composure with which \n",
      "Speranski answered the old man. He appeared to address \n",
      "condescending words to him from an immeasurable \n",
      "height. When the old man began to speak too loud, \n",
      "Speranski smiled and said he could not judge of the \n",
      "advantage or disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign. \n",
      "Having talked for a little wh ile in the general circle, \n",
      "Speranski rose and coming up to Prince Andrew took him \n",
      "along to the other end of the room. It was clear that he \n",

      "‘I had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the \n",

      "Speranski went on to say that honor, l’honeur, cannot \n",
      "be upheld by privileges harmful to the service; that honor, \n",
      "l’honneur, is either a negative concept of not doing what \n",
      "is blameworthy or it is a sour ce of emulation in pursuit of \n",

      "arguments were concise, simple, and clear. \n",
      "‘An institution upholding honor, the source of \n",
      "emulation, is one similar to the Legion d’honneur of the \n",

      "wished to finish amiably an argument which was \n",
      "embarrassing for his companion. ‘If you will do me the \n",
      "honor of calling on me on Wedne sday,’ he added, ‘I will, \n",
      "after talking with  Magnitski, let you know what may \n",

      "During the first weeks of his stay in Petersburg Prince \n",
      "Andrew felt the whole trend of thought he had formed \n",
      "during his life of seclusion quite overshadowed by the \n",
      "trifling cares that engrossed him in that city. \n",
      "On returning home in the evening he would jot down \n",
      "in his notebook four or five necessary calls or \n",
      "appointments for certain hours. The mechanism of life, \n",
      "the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere, \n",
      "absorbed the greater part of  his vital energy. He did \n",
      "nothing, did not even think or  find time to think, but only \n",
      "talked, and talked successfu lly, of what he had thought \n",
      "while in the country. \n",
      "He sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he \n",
      "repeated the same remark on the same day in different \n",
      "circles. But he was so busy fo r whole days together that \n",
      "he had no time to notice that he was thinking of nothing. \n",
      "As he had done on their first meeting at Kochubey’s, \n",
      "Speranski produced a str ong impression on Prince \n",
      "Andrew on the Wednesday, when he received him tete-a-\n",
      "tate at his own house and talked to him long and \n",
      "confidentially. War and Peace  \n",
      "998 of 2882 \n",
      "To Bolkonski so many people appeared contemptible \n",
      "and insignificant creatures, and he so longed to find in \n",
      "someone the living ideal of that perfection toward which \n",
      "he strove, that he readily believed that in Speranski he had \n",
      "found this ideal of a perfectly  rational and virtuous man. \n",
      "Had Speranski sprung from the same class as himself and \n",
      "possessed the same breeding and traditions, Bolkonski \n",
      "would soon have discovered his weak, human, unheroic \n",
      "sides; but as it was, Speransk i’s strange and logical turn \n",
      "of mind inspired him with respect all the more because he \n",
      "did not quite understand him. Moreover, Speranski, either \n",
      "because he appreciated the othe r’s capacity or because he \n",
      "considered it necessary to win him to his side, showed off \n",
      "his dispassionate calm reas onableness before Prince \n",
      "Andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which \n",
      "goes hand in hand with self-a ssurance and consists in a \n",
      "tacit assumption that one’s companion is the only man \n",
      "besides oneself capable of understanding the folly of the \n",

      "one’s own ideas. \n",
      "During their long conversation on Wednesday evening, \n",
      "Speranski more than once remarked: ‘We regard \n",
      "everything that is above the common level of rooted \n",
      "custom...’ or, with a smile: ‘But we want the wolves to be \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "999 of 2882 \n",
      "fed and the sheep to be safe...’ or: ‘They cannot \n",

      "‘We, you and I, understand what they are and who we \n",
      "are.’ \n",
      "This first long conversation with Speranski only \n",
      "strengthened in Prince Andrew the feeling he had \n",
      "experienced toward him at their first meeting. He saw in \n",
      "him a remarkable, clear-thinki ng man of vast intellect \n",
      "who by his energy and persistence had attained power, \n",
      "which he was using solely for the welfare of Russia. In \n",
      "Prince Andrew’s eyes Speranski was the man he would \n",
      "himself have wished to be - one who explained all the \n",
      "facts of life reasonably, cons idered important only what \n",
      "was rational, and was capable of applying the standard of \n",
      "reason to everything. Everything seemed so simple and \n",
      "clear in Speranski’s exposit ion that Prince Andrew \n",
      "involuntarily agreed with hi m about everything. If he \n",
      "replied and argued, it was only because he wished to \n",
      "maintain his independence and not submit to Speranski’s \n",
      "opinions entirely. Everything was right and everything \n",
      "was as it should be: only one  thing disconcerted Prince \n",
      "Andrew. This was Speranski’s cold, mirrorlike look, \n",
      "which did not allow one to penetrate to his soul, and his \n",
      "delicate white hands, which Prince Andrew involuntarily \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1000 of 2882 \n",
      "watched as one does watch the hands of those who \n",
      "possess power. This mirrorlike gaze and those delicate \n",
      "hands irritated Prince Andrew, he knew not why. He was \n",
      "unpleasantly struck, too, by th e excessive contempt for \n",
      "others that he observed in Sp eranski, and by the diversity \n",
      "of lines of argument he used  to support his opinions. He \n",
      "made use of every kind of me ntal device, except analogy, \n",
      "and passed too boldly, it seem ed to Prince Andrew, from \n",
      "one to another. Now he would take up the position of a \n",
      "practical man and condemn dreamers; now that of a \n",
      "satirist, and laugh ironically at his opponents; now grow \n",
      "severely logical, or suddenl y rise to the realm of \n",
      "metaphysics. (This last resource was one he very \n",
      "frequently employed.) He w ould transfer a question to \n",
      "metaphysical heights, pass on to definitions of space, \n",
      "time, and thought, and, having deduced the refutation he \n",
      "needed, would again descend to  the level of the original \n",
      "discussion. \n",
      "In general the trait of Speranski’s mentality which \n",
      "struck Prince Andrew most was his absolute and \n",
      "unshakable belief in the power and authority of reason. It \n",
      "was evident that the thought could never occur to him \n",
      "which to Prince Andrew seemed so natural, namely, that \n",
      "it is after all impossible to e xpress all one thinks; and that \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1001 of 2882 \n",
      "he had never felt the doubt, ‘Is  not all I think and believe \n",
      "nonsense?’ And it was just this peculiarity of Speranski’s \n",
      "mind that particularly attracted Prince Andrew. \n",
      "During the first period of their acquaintance Bolkonski \n",
      "felt a passionate admiration for him similar to that which \n",
      "he had once felt for Bonaparte.  The fact that Speranski \n",
      "was the son of a village priest, and that stupid people \n",
      "might meanly despise hi m on account of his humble \n",
      "origin (as in fact many did) , caused Prince Andrew to \n",
      "cherish his sentiment for him the more, and unconsciously \n",
      "to strengthen it. \n",
      "On that first evening Bolkonski spent with him, having \n",
      "mentioned the Commission for the Revision of the Code \n",
      "of Laws, Speranski told him sarcastically that the \n",
      "Commission had existed for a hundred and fifty years, \n",
      "had cost millions, and ha d done nothing except that \n",
      "Rosenkampf had stuck labels on the corresponding \n",
      "paragraphs of the different codes. \n",
      "‘And that is all the state has for the millions it has \n",
      "spent,’ said he. ‘We want to give the Senate new juridical \n",
      "powers, but we have no laws. That is why it is a sin for \n",
      "men like you, Prince, not to serve in these times!’ \n",
      "Prince Andrew said that for that work an education in \n",
      "jurisprudence was needed which he did not possess. War and Peace  \n",
      "1002 of 2882 \n",
      "‘But nobody possesses it, so what would you have? It \n",
      "is a vicious circle from which we must break a way out.’ \n",
      "A week later Prince Andrew was a member of the \n",
      "Committee on Army Regulations and- what he had not at \n",
      "all expected- was chairman of a section of the committee \n",
      "for the revision of the laws. At Speranski’s request he \n",
      "took the first part of the Civ il Code that was being drawn \n",
      "up and, with the aid of the Code Napoleon and the \n",

      "returning to Petersburg afte r visiting his estates had \n",
      "involuntarily found himself in a leading position among \n",
      "the Petersburg Freemasons. He arranged dining and \n",
      "funeral lodge meetings, enrolled new members, and \n",
      "busied himself uniting various lodges and acquiring \n",
      "authentic charters. He gave  money for the erection of \n",

      "ground on which he stood gave way under him. At the War and Peace  \n",
      "1004 of 2882 \n",
      "same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under \n",
      "him the closer bound he involuntarily became to the \n",

      "experienced the feeling of one who confidently steps onto \n",

      "sank in. To make quite sure of the firmness the ground, he \n",

      "Joseph Alexeevich was not in  Petersburg- he had of \n",

      "and lived almost entirely in Moscow. All the members of \n",
      "the lodges were men Pierre kne w in ordinary life, and it \n",
      "was difficult for him to regard them merely as Brothers in \n",
      "Freemasonry and not as Prince B. or Ivan Vasilevich D., \n",
      "whom he knew in society mostly as weak and \n",
      "insignificant men. Under the Ma sonic aprons and insignia \n",

      "tried not to dwell arose in his soul. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1005 of 2882 \n",
      "He divided the Brothers he knew into four categories. \n",
      "In the first he put those who did not take an active part in \n",
      "the affairs of the lodges or in human affairs, but were \n",
      "exclusively occupied with th e mystical science of the \n",
      "order: with questions of the threefold designation of God, \n",
      "the three primordial elements- sulphur, mercury, and salt- \n",
      "or the meaning of the square and all the various figures of \n",
      "the temple of Solomon. Pierre respected this class of \n",
      "Brothers to which the el der ones chiefly belonged, \n",
      "including, Pierre thought, Jose ph Alexeevich himself, but \n",
      "he did not share their interest s. His heart was not in the \n",
      "mystical aspect of Freemasonry. \n",
      "In the second category Pierre reckoned himself and \n",
      "others like him, seeking and vacillating, who had not yet \n",
      "found in Freemasonry a straight and comprehensible path, \n",
      "but hoped to do so. \n",
      "In the third category he incl uded those Brothers (the \n",
      "majority) who saw nothing in Freemasonry but the \n",
      "external forms and ceremonies, and prized the strict \n",
      "performance of these forms without troubling about their \n",
      "purport or significance. Such were Willarski and even the \n",
      "Grand Master of the principal lodge. \n",
      "Finally, to the fourth cat egory also a great many \n",
      "Brothers belonged, particular ly those who had lately War and Peace  \n",
      "1006 of 2882 \n",
      "joined. These according to Pierre’s observations were \n",
      "men who had no belief in anything, nor desire for \n",
      "anything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate \n",
      "with the wealthy young Brothers who were influential \n",
      "through their connections or rank, and of whom there \n",
      "were very many in the lodge. \n",
      "Pierre began to feel dissa tisfied with what he was \n",
      "doing. Freemasonry, at any ra te as he saw it here, \n",
      "sometimes seemed to him based merely on externals. He \n",
      "did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself, but \n",
      "suspected that Russian Mas onry had taken a wrong path \n",
      "and deviated from its original  principles. And so toward \n",

      "many highly placed persons, had been initiated into many \n",
      "mysteries, had been raised to a higher grade, and was \n",
      "bringing back with him much  that might conduce to the \n",
      "advantage of the Masonic cause in Russia. The Petersburg \n",
      "Freemasons all came to see him, tried to ingratiate \n",
      "themselves with him, and it seemed to them all that he \n",
      "was preparing something for them and concealing it. \n",

      "1007 of 2882 \n",
      "A solemn meeting of the l odge of the second degree \n",

      "to the Petersburg Brothers what he had to deliver to them \n",
      "from the highest leaders of their order. The meeting was a \n",
      "full one. After the usual ceremonies Pierre rose and began \n",
      "his address. \n",
      "‘Dear Brothers,’ he began, blushing and stammering, \n",
      "with a written speech in his hand, ‘it is not sufficient to \n",
      "observe our mysteries in the seclusion of our lodge- we \n",
      "must act- act! We are drowsing, but we must act.’ Pierre \n",
      "raised his notebook and began to read. \n",
      "‘For the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the \n",
      "triumph of virtue,’ he read, ‘we must cleanse men from \n",
      "prejudice, diffuse principles in harmony with the spirit of \n",

      "ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the wisest men, \n",

      "and power. \n",
      "‘To attain this end we must  secure a preponderance of \n",
      "virtue over vice and must endeavor to secure that the \n",
      "honest man may, even in this world, receive a lasting \n",
      "reward for his virtue. But in these great endeavors we are War and Peace  \n",
      "1008 of 2882 \n",
      "gravely hampered by the polit ical institutions of today. \n",
      "What is to be done in these circumstances? To favor \n",
      "revolutions, overthrow everything, repel force by force?... \n",
      "No! We are very far from that. Every violent reform \n",
      "deserves censure, for it qui te fails to remedy evil while \n",
      "men remain what they are, and also because wisdom \n",
      "needs no violence. \n",
      "‘The whole plan of our order should be based on the \n",
      "idea of preparing men of firmness and virtue bound \n",
      "together by unity of conviction- aiming at the punishment \n",
      "of vice and folly, and patronizing talent and virtue: raising \n",
      "worthy men from the dust and attaching them to our \n",

      "unobtrusively to bind the ha nds of the protectors of \n",
      "disorder and to control them without their being aware of \n",
      "it. In a word, we must found a form of government \n",

      "whole world without destroying the bonds of citizenship, \n",
      "and beside which all other governments can continue in \n",
      "their customary course and do everything except what \n",
      "impedes the great aim of our order, which is to obtain for \n",
      "virtue the victory over vice . This aim was that of \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1009 of 2882 \n",
      "for their own benefit to follow the example and \n",
      "instruction of the best and wisest men. \n",
      "‘At that time, when ever ything was plunged in \n",
      "darkness, preaching alone was of course sufficient. The \n",
      "novelty of Truth endowed her with special strength, but \n",
      "now we need much more powerful methods. It is now \n",
      "necessary that man, governed by his senses, should find in \n",
      "virtue a charm palpable to those senses. It is impossible to \n",
      "eradicate the passions; but we mu st strive to direct them \n",
      "to a noble aim, and it is th erefore necessary that everyone \n",
      "should be able to satisfy his passions within the limits of \n",
      "virtue. Our order should provide means to that end. \n",
      "‘As soon as we have a certain number of worthy men \n",

      "met it with a coldness that surprised Pierre. The Grand \n",
      "Master began answering him, and Pierre began \n",

      "long since there had been so stormy a meeting. Parties War and Peace  \n",
      "1010 of 2882 \n",
      "were formed, some accusing Pierre of Illuminism, others \n",

      "two persons. Even those memb ers who seemed to be on \n",

      "telling me something about th e teaching of our order, but War and Peace  \n",
      "1028 of 2882 \n",
      "so softly that I could not hear it. Then it seemed that we \n",
      "all left the room and something strange happened. We \n",
      "were sitting or lying on the floor. He was telling me \n",
      "something, and I wished to show him my sensibility, and \n",
      "not listening to what he was saying I began picturing to \n",
      "myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of \n",
      "God sanctifying me. And tears came into my eyes, and I \n",
      "was glad he noticed this. But be looked at me with \n",
      "vexation and jumped up, breaking off his remarks. I felt \n",
      "abashed and asked whether wh at he had been saying did \n",
      "not concern me; but he did not reply, gave me a kind look, \n",
      "and then we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom \n",
      "where there is a double bed. He lay down on the edge of it \n",
      "and I burned with longing to caress him and lie down too. \n",
      "And he said, ‘Tell me fr ankly what is your chief \n",
      "temptation? Do you know it? I think you know it already.’ \n",
      "Abashed by this question, I replied that sloth was my \n",

      "even more abashed, I said that though I was living with \n",
      "my wife as he advised, I wa s not living with her as her \n",
      "husband. To this he replied that one should not deprive a \n",
      "wife of one’s embraces and gave me to understand that \n",
      "that was my duty. But I replied that I should be ashamed \n",

      "and he said, ‘Hast thou noticed that my face is different?’ \n",
      "I looked at him, still holding him in my arms, and saw \n",
      "that his face was young, but that he had no hair on his \n",

      "he had, what his debts amount ed to, or what dowry he \n",
      "could give Vera. When his daughters were born he had \n",
      "assigned to each of them, for her dowry, an estate with \n",
      "three hundred serfs; but one of  these estates had already \n",
      "been sold, and the other was mortgaged and the interest so \n",

      "nor spoken to his wi fe about it. At one time the count \n",
      "thought of giving her the Ryazan estate or of selling a \n",
      "forest, at another time of  borrowing money on a note of \n",

      "him know what Vera’s dowry would be. The count was so \n",
      "disconcerted by this long-fore seen inquiry that without \n",

      "Boris’ uniform, spurs, tie, and the way his hair was \n",

      "society, recalling with mild  irony old times in Moscow \n",
      "and Moscow acquaintances. It was not accidentally, \n",

      "Boris more and more. He l ooked round more frequently \n",
      "toward her, and broke off in what he was saying. He did \n",
      "not stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his \n",
      "leave. The same inquisitiv e, challenging, and rather \n",
      "mocking eyes still looked at him. After his first visit Boris \n",
      "said to himself that Natasha attracted him just as much as \n",
      "ever, but that he must not yiel d to that feeling, because to \n",
      "marry her, a girl almost without fortune, would mean ruin \n",

      "made up his mind to avoid meeting Natasha, but despite \n",
      "that resolution he called again a few days later and began \n",
      "calling often and spending whole days at the Rostovs’. It \n",
      "seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with \n",

      "that in spite of everything... she could not be his wife, that \n",
      "he had no means, and they would never let her marry him. \n",
      "But he failed to do so and fe lt awkward about entering on \n",

      "him his favorite songs, show ed him her album, making War and Peace  \n",
      "1042 of 2882 \n",

      "was high, with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller \n",

      "1044 of 2882 \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1059 of 2882 \n",

      "‘Charming!’ said he, kissing the tips of his fingers. \n",
      "In the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance \n",

      "position in one of the front ro ws of that crowd. Natasha \n",
      "heard and felt that several people were asking about her \n",
      "and looking at her. She real ized that those noticing her \n",

      "When the cotillion was over th e old count in his blue \n",
      "coat came up to the dancers. He invited Prince Andrew to \n",

      "can you ask such a question?’ \n",
      "‘I have never enjoyed myself so much before!’ she \n",

      "Chapter XVIII \n",
      "Next day Prince Andrew thought of the ball, but his \n",
      "mind did not dwell on it long. ‘Yes, it was a very brilliant \n",
      "ball,’ and then... ‘Yes, that little Rostova is very \n",
      "charming. There’s something fresh, original, un-\n",
      "Petersburg-like about her that distinguishes her.’ That was \n",
      "all he thought about yester day’s ball, and after his \n",
      "morning tea he set to work. \n",
      "But either from fatigue or want of sleep he was ill-\n",
      "disposed for work and could get nothing done. He kept \n",
      "criticizing his own work, as he often did, and was glad \n",
      "when he heard someone coming. \n",
      "The visitor was Bitski, who served on various \n",
      "committees, frequented all the societies in Petersburg, and \n",
      "a passionate devotee of the ne w ideas and of Speranski, \n",
      "and a diligent Petersburg newsmonger- one of those men \n",
      "who choose their opinions like their clothes according to \n",
      "the fashion, but who for that very reason appear to be the \n",
      "warmest partisans. Hardly had he got rid of his hat before \n",
      "he ran into Prince Andrew’s room with a preoccupied air \n",
      "and at once began talking. He had just heard particulars of \n",
      "that morning’s sitting of the Council of State opened by \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1075 of 2882 \n",
      "the Emperor, and he spoke of it enthusiastically. The \n",
      "Emperor’s speech had been extraordinary. It had been a \n",
      "speech such as only constitutional monarchs deliver. ‘The \n",
      "Sovereign plainly said that the Council and Senate are \n",
      "estates of the realm, he said that the government must rest \n",
      "not on authority but on secure  bases. The Emperor said \n",
      "that the fiscal system must be reorganized and the \n",
      "accounts published,’ recount ed Bitski, emphasizing \n",
      "certain words and opening his eyes significantly. \n",
      "‘Ah, yes! Today’s events mark an epoch, the greatest \n",
      "epoch in our history,’ he concluded. \n",
      "Prince Andrew listened to the account of the opening \n",
      "of the Council of State, which he had so impatiently \n",
      "awaited and to which he had attached such importance, \n",
      "and was surprised that this event, now that it had taken \n",
      "place, did not affect him, and even seemed quite \n",
      "insignificant. He listened w ith quiet irony to Bitski’s \n",
      "enthusiastic account of it. A very simple thought occurred \n",
      "to him: ‘What does it matter to me or to Bitski what the \n",
      "Emperor was pleased to say at the Council? Can all that \n",
      "make me any happier or better?’ \n",
      "And this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the \n",
      "interest Prince Andrew had fe lt in the impending reforms. \n",
      "He was going to dine that evening at Speranski’s, ‘with War and Peace  \n",
      "1076 of 2882 \n",
      "only a few friends,’ as the host had said when inviting \n",
      "him. The prospect of that dinner in the intimate home \n",
      "circle of the man he so ad mired had greatly interested \n",
      "Prince Andrew, especially as he had not yet seen \n",
      "Speranski in his domestic su rroundings, but now he felt \n",
      "disinclined to go to it. \n",
      "At the appointed hour, howeve r, he entered the modest \n",
      "house Speranski owned in the Taurida Gardens. In the \n",
      "parqueted dining room this small house, remarkable for \n",
      "its extreme cleanliness (sugges ting that of a monastery), \n",
      "Prince Andrew, who was rath er late, found the friendly \n",
      "gathering of Speranski’s intimate acquaintances already \n",
      "assembled at five o’clock. There were no ladies present \n",
      "except Speranski’s little daughter (long-faced like her \n",
      "father) and her governess. The other guests were Gervais, \n",
      "Magnitski, and Stolypin. While  still in the anteroom \n",
      "Prince Andrew heard loud voi ces and a ringing staccato \n",
      "laugh- a laugh such as one hears on the stage. Someone- it \n",
      "sounded like Speranski- was di stinctly ejaculating ha-ha-\n",
      "ha. Prince Andrew had never before heard Speranski’s \n",
      "famous laugh, and this ringing, high pitched laughter from \n",
      "a statesman made a strange impression on him. \n",
      "He entered the dining room. The whole company were \n",
      "standing between two windows at  a small table laid with \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1077 of 2882 \n",
      "hors-d’oeuvres. Speranski, wearing a gray swallow-tail \n",
      "coat with a star on the breast, and evidently still the same \n",
      "waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the \n",
      "meeting of the Council of State, stood at the table with a \n",
      "beaming countenance. His guests surrounded him. \n",
      "Magnitski, addressing himself to Speranski, was relating \n",
      "an anecdote, and Speranski was laughing in advance at \n",
      "what Magnitski was going to say. When Prince Andrew \n",
      "entered the room Magnitski’s words were again crowned \n",
      "by laughter. Stolypin gave a deep bass guffaw as he \n",
      "munched a piece of bread and cheese. Gervais laughed \n",
      "softly with a hiss ing chuckle, and Speranski in a high-\n",
      "pitched staccato manner. \n",
      "Still laughing, Speranski held out his soft white hand \n",
      "to Prince Andrew. \n",
      "‘Very pleased to see you, Prince,’ he said. ‘One \n",
      "moment...’ he went on, turning to Magnitski and \n",
      "interrupting his story. ‘We ha ve agreed that this is a \n",
      "dinner for recreation, with not  a word about business!’ \n",
      "and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh. \n",
      "Prince Andrew looked at the laughing Sper anski with \n",
      "astonishment, regret, and disillusionment. It seemed to \n",
      "him that this was not Speranski but someone else. \n",
      "Everything that had formerly appeared mysterious and War and Peace  \n",
      "1078 of 2882 \n",
      "fascinating in Speranski suddenly became plain and \n",
      "unattractive. \n",
      "At dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment \n",
      "and seemed to consist of the contents of a book of funny \n",
      "anecdotes. Before Magnitski  had finished his story \n",
      "someone else was anxious to relate something still \n",
      "funnier. Most of the anecdotes, if not relating to the state \n",
      "service, related to people in th e service. It seemed that in \n",
      "this company the insignifi cance of those people was so \n",
      "definitely accepted that the only possible attitude toward \n",
      "them was one of good humored ridicule. Speranski related \n",
      "how at the Council that morn ing a deaf dignitary, when \n",
      "asked his opinion, replied that  he thought so too. Gervais \n",
      "gave a long account of an official revision, remarkable for \n",
      "the stupidity of everybody concerned. Stolypin, stuttering, \n",
      "broke into the conversation and began excitedly talking of \n",
      "the abuses that existed under the former order of things- \n",
      "threatening to give a serious  turn to the conversation. \n",
      "Magnitski starting quizzi ng Stolypin about his \n",
      "vehemence. Gervais intervened with a joke, and the talk \n",
      "reverted to its former lively tone. \n",
      "Evidently Speranski liked to rest after his labors and \n",
      "find amusement in a circle of friends, and his guests, \n",
      "understanding his wish, tried to enliven him and amuse \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1079 of 2882 \n",
      "themselves. But their gaiety seemed to Prince Andrew \n",
      "mirthless and tiresome. Speranski’s high-pitched voice \n",
      "struck him unpleasantly, and th e incessant laughter grated \n",
      "on him like a false note. Prince Andrew did not laugh and \n",
      "feared that he would be a damper on the spirits of the \n",
      "company, but no one took any notice of his being out of \n",
      "harmony with the general mood. They all seemed very \n",
      "gay. \n",
      "He tried several times to jo in in the conversation, but \n",
      "his remarks were tossed aside each time like a cork \n",
      "thrown out of the water, and he could not jest with them. \n",
      "There was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they \n",
      "said, it was witty and might have been funny, but it lacked \n",
      "just that something which is the salt of mirth, and they \n",
      "were not even aware that such a thing existed. \n",
      "After dinner Speranski’s daughter and her governess \n",
      "rose. He patted the little gi rl with his white hand and \n",
      "kissed her. And that gesture,  too, seemed unnatural to \n",
      "Prince Andrew. \n",
      "The men remained at table over their port- English \n",
      "fashion. In the midst of a c onversation that was started \n",
      "about Napoleon’s Spanish affairs, which they all agreed \n",
      "in approving, Prince Andrew began to express a contrary \n",
      "opinion. Speranski smiled and, with an evident wish to War and Peace  \n",
      "1080 of 2882 \n",
      "prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant \n",
      "course, told a story that had no connection with the \n",
      "previous conversation. For a few moments all were silent. \n",
      "Having sat some time at table, Speranski corked a \n",
      "bottle of wine and, rema rking, ‘Nowadays good wine \n",
      "rides in a carriage and pair,’ passed it to the servant and \n",
      "got up. All rose and continuing to talk loudly went into \n",
      "the drawing room. Two letters brought by a courier were \n",
      "handed to Speranski and he took them to his study. As \n",
      "soon as he had left the room the general merriment \n",
      "stopped and the guests began to converse sensibly and \n",
      "quietly with one another. \n",
      "‘Now for the recitation!’ said Speranski on returning \n",
      "from his study. ‘A wonderful talent!’ he said to Prince \n",
      "Andrew, and Magnitski immediately assumed a pose and \n",
      "began reciting some humorous verses in French which he \n",
      "had composed about various well-known Petersburg \n",
      "people. He was interrupted several times by applause. \n",
      "When the verses were finished Prince Andrew went up to \n",
      "Speranski and took his leave. \n",
      "‘Where are you off to so early?’ asked Speranski. \n",
      "‘I promised to go to a reception.’ \n",
      "They said no more. Prince Andrew looked closely into \n",
      "those mirrorlike, impenetrable eyes, and felt that it had \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1081 of 2882 \n",
      "been ridiculous of him to have expected anything from \n",
      "Speranski and from any of his own activities connected \n",
      "with him, or ever to have attributed importance to what \n",
      "Speranski was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter \n",
      "rang in Prince Andrew’s ears long after he had left the \n",
      "house. \n",
      "When he reached home Prince Andrew began thinking \n",
      "of his life in Petersburg during those last four months as if \n",
      "it were something new. He recalled his exertions and \n",
      "solicitations, and the history of his project of army \n",
      "reform, which had been accepted for consideration and \n",
      "which they were trying to pass over in silence simply \n",
      "because another, a very poor one, had already been \n",
      "prepared and submitted to the Emperor. He thought of the \n",
      "meetings of a committee of which Berg was a member. \n",
      "He remembered how carefully and at what length \n",
      "everything relating to form and procedure was discussed \n",
      "at those meetings, and how sedulously and promptly all \n",
      "that related to the gist of  the business was evaded. He \n",
      "recalled his labors on the Legal Code, and how \n",
      "painstakingly he had translated  the articles of the Roman \n",
      "and French codes into Russian, and he felt ashamed of \n",
      "himself. Then he vividly pictured to himself \n",
      "Bogucharovo, his occupations in  the country, his journey War and Peace  \n",
      "1082 of 2882 \n",
      "to Ryazan; he remembered the peasants and Dron the \n",
      "village elder, and mentally applying to them the Personal \n",
      "Rights he had divided into para graphs, he felt astonished \n",
      "that he could have spent so much time on such useless \n",
      "work. \n",

      "1083 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XIX \n",
      "Next day Prince Andrew called at a few houses he had \n",
      "not visited before, and among them at the Rostovs’ with \n",
      "whom he had renewed acquaintance at the ball. Apart \n",
      "from considerations of politeness which demanded the \n",
      "call, he wanted to see that original, eager girl who had left \n",
      "such a pleasant impression on his mind, in her own home. \n",
      "Natasha was one of the first to meet him. She was \n",
      "wearing a dark-blue house dre ss in which Prince Andrew \n",
      "thought her even prettier than in her ball dress. She and all \n",
      "the Rostov family welcomed him as an old friend, simply \n",
      "and cordially. The whole family, whom he had formerly \n",
      "judged severely, now seemed to him to consist of \n",
      "excellent, simple, and kindly people. The old count’s \n",
      "hospitality and good nature, wh ich struck one especially \n",
      "in Petersburg as a pleasant surprise, were such that Prince \n",
      "Andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner. ‘Yes,’ he \n",
      "thought, ‘they are capital people, who of course have not \n",
      "the slightest idea what a treasure they possess in Natasha; \n",
      "but they are kindly folk and form the best possible setting \n",
      "for this strikingly poetic, charming girl, overflowing with \n",
      "life!’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1084 of 2882 \n",
      "In Natasha Prince Andrew wa s conscious of a strange \n",
      "world completely alien to him and brimful of joys \n",
      "unknown to him, a different wo rld, that in the Otradnoe \n",
      "avenue and at the window that moonlight night had \n",
      "already begun to disconcert him. Now this world \n",
      "disconcerted him no longer a nd was no longer alien to \n",
      "him, but he himself having entered it found in it a new \n",
      "enjoyment. \n",
      "After dinner Natasha, at Prince Andrew’s request, went \n",
      "to the clavichord and began singing. Prince Andrew stood \n",
      "by a window talking to the ladies  and listened to her. In \n",
      "the midst of a phrase he ceased speaking and suddenly felt \n",
      "tears choking him, a thing he had thought impossible for \n",
      "him. He looked at Natasha as she sang, and something \n",
      "new and joyful stirred in his soul. He felt happy and at the \n",
      "same time sad. He had absolutely nothing to weep about \n",
      "yet he was ready to weep. What about? His former love? \n",
      "The little princess? His disi llusionments?... His hopes for \n",
      "the future?... Yes and no. The chief reason was a sudden, \n",
      "vivid sense of the terrible contrast between something \n",
      "infinitely great and illimitable within him and that limited \n",
      "and material something that he, and even she, was. This \n",
      "contrast weighed on and yet cheered him while she sang. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1085 of 2882 \n",
      "As soon as Natasha had finished she went up to him \n",
      "and asked how he liked her voice. She asked this and then \n",
      "became confused, feeling that she ought not to have asked \n",
      "it. He smiled, looking at her, and said he liked her singing \n",
      "as he liked everything she did. \n",
      "Prince Andrew left the Rostovs’ late in the evening. He \n",
      "went to bed from habit, but soon realized that he could not \n",
      "sleep. Having lit his candle he sat up in bed, then got up, \n",
      "then lay down again not at all troubled by his \n",
      "sleeplessness: his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he had \n",
      "stepped out of a stuffy room into God’s own fresh air. It \n",
      "did not enter his head that he was in love with Natasha; he \n",
      "was not thinking about her, but only picturing her to \n",
      "himself, and in consequence all life appeared in a new \n",
      "light. ‘Why do I strive, why do I toil in this narrow, \n",
      "confined frame, when life, all life with all its joys, is open \n",
      "to me?’ said he to himself. And for the first time for a \n",
      "very long while he began making happy plans for the \n",
      "future. He decided that he  must attend to his son’s \n",
      "education by finding a tuto r and putting the boy in his \n",
      "charge, then he ought to reti re from the service and go \n",
      "abroad, and see England, Switzerland and Italy. ‘I must \n",
      "use my freedom while I feel so much strength and youth \n",
      "in me,’ he said to himself. ‘Pierre was right when he said War and Peace  \n",
      "1086 of 2882 \n",
      "one must believe in the possibility of happiness in order to \n",
      "be happy, and now I do believe in it. Let the dead bury \n",
      "their dead, but while one has life one must live and be \n",
      "happy!’ thought he. \n",
      "CHAPTER XX \n",
      "One morning Colonel Berg, whom Pierre knew as he \n",
      "knew everybody in Moscow and Petersburg, came to see \n",
      "him. Berg arrived in an immaculate brand-new uniform, \n",
      "with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his \n",
      "temples as the Emperor Alexander wore his hair. \n",
      "‘I have just been to s ee the countess, your wife. \n",
      "Unfortunately she could not grant my request, but I hope, \n",
      "Count, I shall be more fortunate with you,’ he said with a \n",
      "smile. \n",
      "‘What is it you wish, Colonel? I am at your service.’ \n",
      "‘I have now quite settled in my new rooms, Count’ \n",
      "(Berg said this with perf ect conviction that this \n",
      "information could not but be ag reeable), ‘and so I wish to \n",
      "arrange just a small party for my own and my wife’s \n",
      "friends.’ (He smiled still more pleasantly.) ‘I wished to \n",
      "ask the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to \n",
      "tea and to supper.’ \n",
      "Only Countess Helene, consid ering the society of such \n",
      "people as the Bergs beneath her, could be cruel enough to \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1087 of 2882 \n",
      "refuse such an invitation. Berg explained so clearly why \n",
      "he wanted to collect at hi s house a small but select \n",
      "company, and why this would give him pleasure, and why \n",
      "though he grudged spending money on cards or anything \n",
      "harmful, he was prepared to run into some expense for the \n",
      "sake of good society- that Pierre could not refuse, and \n",
      "promised to come. \n",
      "‘But don’t be late, Count, if  I may venture to ask; \n",
      "about ten minutes to eight, please. We shall make up a \n",
      "rubber. Our general is coming. He is very good to me. We \n",
      "shall have supper, Count. So you will do me the favor.’ \n",
      "Contrary to his habit of being late, Pierre on that day \n",
      "arrived at the Bergs’ house, not at ten but  at fifteen \n",
      "minutes to eight. \n",
      "Having prepared everything necessary for the party, \n",
      "the Bergs were really for their guests’ arrival. \n",
      "In their new, clean, and light study with its small busts \n",
      "and pictures and new furnitu re sat Berg and his wife. \n",
      "Berg, closely buttoned up in his new uniform, sat beside \n",
      "his wife explaining to her that one always could and \n",
      "should be acquainted with people above one, because \n",
      "only then does one get satisfaction from acquaintances. \n",
      "‘You can get to know something, you can ask for \n",
      "something. See how I managed from my first promotion.’ War and Peace  \n",

      "‘My comrades are still nobodies, while I am only waiting \n",

      "happiness to be your husba nd.’ (He rose and kissed \n",
      "Vera’s hand, and on the way to her straightened out a \n",
      "turned-up corner of the carpet.) ‘And how have I obtained \n",

      "1093 of 2882 \n",
      "and evidently trying to mast er her rapid breathing. And \n",
      "the bright glow of some inner fire that had been \n",

      "1094 of 2882 \n",
      "began a conversation with him about feelings in general \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1095 of 2882 \n",

      "human characteristics change with the times- ‘in our days \n",
      "a girl has so much freedom that the pleasure of being \n",

      "the subject of Natalie caused  Prince Andrew to knit his \n",

      "‘I think no one has been more courted than she,’ she \n",
      "went on, ‘but till quite lately she never cared seriously for \n",

      "he rose, taking Pierre by the arm, and drew him aside. \n",

      "Since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of \n",

      "of the bedchamber, and from that time he had begun to \n",
      "feel oppressed and ashamed in  court society, and dark \n",
      "thoughts of the vanity of all things human came to him \n",
      "oftener than before. At the same time the feeling he had \n",
      "noticed between his protegee Natasha and Prince Andrew \n",
      "accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own \n",
      "position and his friend’s. He tried equally to avoid \n",

      "Andrew; and again everything seemed to him \n",
      "insignificant in comparison with eternity; again the \n",
      "question: for what? presented itself; and he forced himself \n",
      "to work day and night at Masonic labors, hoping to drive \n",
      "away the evil spirit that threatened him. Toward midnight, \n",
      "after he had left the countess’  apartments, he was sitting \n",
      "upstairs in a shabby dressi ng gown, copying out the \n",
      "original transaction of the Scottish lodge of Freemasons at War and Peace  \n",
      "1102 of 2882 \n",
      "a table in his low room cloudy with tobacco smoke, when \n",
      "someone came in. It was Prince Andrew. \n",
      "‘Ah, it’s you!’ said Pierre  with a preoccupied, \n",

      "to his manuscript book with th at air of escaping from the \n",
      "ills of life with which unhappy people look at their work. \n",
      "Prince Andrew, with a beaming, ecstatic expression of \n",
      "renewed life on his face, paused in front of Pierre and, not \n",

      "joy. \n",
      "‘Well, dear heart,’ said he, ‘I wanted to tell you about \n",

      "‘Yes, yes! Who else should it be? I should never have \n",

      "even that torment for anythi ng in the world, I have not \n",
      "lived till now. At la st I live, but I can’ t live without her! \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1103 of 2882 \n",
      "‘I? I? What did I tell you?’ said Pierre suddenly, rising \n",
      "and beginning to pace up and down the room. ‘I always \n",
      "thought it.... That girl is such  a treasure... she is a rare \n",
      "girl.... My dear friend, I en treat you, don’t philosophize, \n",
      "don’t doubt, marry, marry, marry.... And I am sure there \n",

      "‘But what of her?’ \n",

      "‘She does, I know,’ Pierre cried fiercely. \n",
      "‘But do listen,’ returned Prince Andrew, holding him \n",

      "‘Well, go on, go on. I am very glad,’ said Pierre, and \n",
      "his face really changed, his brow became smooth, and he \n",
      "listened gladly to Prince Andrew. Prince Andrew seemed, \n",
      "and really was, quite a diffe rent, quite a new man. Where \n",
      "was his spleen, his contempt fo r life, his disillusionment? \n",
      "Pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind \n",
      "to speak openly; and to him he told all that was in his \n",
      "soul. Now he boldly and li ghtly made plans for an \n",
      "extended future, said he c ould not sacrifice his own \n",
      "happiness to his father’s cap rice, and spoke of how he War and Peace  \n",
      "1104 of 2882 \n",
      "would either make his father consent to this marriage and \n",
      "love her, or would do without his consent; then he \n",
      "marveled at the feeling that had mastered him as at \n",
      "something strange, apart from and independent of \n",
      "himself. \n",
      "‘I should not have believed anyone who told me that I \n",
      "was capable of such love,’ sa id Prince Andrew. ‘It is not \n",
      "at all the same feeling that I knew in the past. The whole \n",
      "world is now for me divided in to two halves: one half is \n",
      "she, and there all is joy, hope, light: th e other half is \n",
      "everything where she is not, and there is all gloom and \n",

      "‘I cannot help loving the light, it is not my fault. And I \n",
      "am very happy! You understand me? I know you are glad \n",
      "for my sake.’ \n",
      "‘Yes, yes,’ Pierre assented, looking at his friend with a \n",

      "comprehend how anyone could wi sh to alter his life or \n",
      "introduce anything new into it, when his own life was \n",
      "already ending. ‘If only they would let me end my days as \n",
      "I want to,’ thought the old man, ‘then they might do as \n",
      "they please.’ With his son, however, he employed the \n",

      "adopting a quiet tone, discussed the whole matter. \n",
      "In the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as \n",

      "was no longer as young as he had been and his health was \n",
      "poor (the old man laid special  stress on this), while she \n",
      "was very young. Thirdly, he had a son whom it would be \n",
      "a pity to entrust to a chit of  a girl. ‘Fourthly and finally,’ \n",
      "the father said, looking ironica lly at his son, ‘I beg you to \n",

      "you wanted to for a German tutor for Prince Nicholas. War and Peace  \n",
      "1106 of 2882 \n",
      "Then if your love or passion or obstinacy- as you please- \n",
      "is still as great, marry! And that’s my last word on it. \n",
      "Mind, the last...’ concluded th e prince, in a tone which \n",

      "Prince Andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that \n",
      "his feelings, or his fiancee’s, would not stand a year’s test, \n",
      "or that he (the old prince hi mself) would die before then, \n",
      "and he decided to conform to his father’s wish- to \n",

      "Three weeks after the last evening he had spent with \n",
      "the Rostovs, Prince Andrew returned to Petersburg. \n",
      "Next day after her talk with her mother Natasha \n",

      "Three weeks passed in this way. Natasha had no desire \n",

      "a shadow, idle and listless; sh e wept secretly at night and \n",
      "did not go to her mother in  the evenings. She blushed \n",
      "continually and was irritable. It seemed to her that \n",
      "everybody knew about her di sappointment and was \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1107 of 2882 \n",
      "laughing at her and pitying her.  Strong as was her inward \n",
      "grief, this wound to her vanity intensified her misery. \n",
      "Once she came to her mother, tried to say something, \n",
      "and suddenly began to cry. He r tears were those of an \n",
      "offended child who does not know why it is being \n",
      "punished. \n",
      "The countess began to soothe  Natasha, who after first \n",
      "listening to her mother’s words, suddenly interrupted her: \n",
      "‘Leave off, Mamma! I don’t think, and don’t want to \n",
      "think about it! He just came and then left off, left off..’ \n",
      "Her voice trembled, and she again nearly cried, but \n",
      "recovered and went on quietly: \n",

      "of him; I have now become quite calm, quite calm.’ \n",
      "The day after this conversa tion Natasha put on the old \n",

      "conducing to cheerfulness in the mornings, and that day \n",
      "she returned to the old way of life which she had \n",
      "abandoned since the ball. Having finished her morning tea \n",
      "she went to the ballroom, which she particularly liked for \n",
      "its loud resonance, and began singing her solfeggio. When \n",
      "she had finished her first exer cise she stood still in the \n",
      "middle of the room and sa ng a musical phrase that \n",
      "particularly pleased her. She listened joyfully (as though \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1108 of 2882 \n",
      "she had not expected it) to  the charm of the notes \n",
      "reverberating, filling the whole empty ballroom, and \n",
      "slowly dying away; and all at once she felt cheerful. \n",
      "‘What’s the good of making so much of it? Things are \n",
      "nice as it is,’ she said to herself, and she began walking up \n",
      "and down the room, not stepping simply on the \n",
      "resounding parquet but treading with each step from the \n",
      "heel to the toe (she had on a new and favorite pair of \n",
      "shoes) and listening to the re gular tap of the heel and \n",
      "creak of the toe as gladly as she had to the sounds of her \n",
      "own voice. Passing a mirror she glanced into it. ‘There, \n",
      "that’s me!’ the expression of her face seemed to say as \n",

      "A footman wanted to come in to clear away something \n",
      "in the room but she would not let him, and having closed \n",
      "the door behind him continued her walk. That morning \n",
      "she had returned to her fa vorite mood- love of, and \n",
      "delight in, herself. ‘How charming that Natasha is!’ she \n",
      "said again, speaking as some third, collective, male \n",
      "person. ‘Pretty, a good voice, young, and in nobody’s way \n",
      "if only they leave her in peace.’ But however much they \n",
      "left her in peace she could not now be at peace, and \n",
      "immediately felt this. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1109 of 2882 \n",
      "In the hall the porch door opened, and someone asked, \n",
      "‘At home?’ and then footstep s were heard. Natasha was \n",
      "looking at the mirror, but did not see herself. She listened \n",
      "to the sounds in the hall. When  she saw herself, her face \n",
      "was pale. It was he. She knew this for certain, though she \n",
      "hardly heard his voice through the closed doors. \n",
      "Pale and agitated, Natasha ran into the drawing room. \n",
      "‘Mamma! Bolkonski has come!’ she said. ‘Mamma, it \n",
      "is awful, it is unbearable! I don’t want... to be tormented? \n",
      "What am I to do?..’ \n",
      "Before the countess could answer, Prince Andrew \n",
      "entered the room with an agitated and serious face. As \n",
      "soon as he saw Natasha his face brightened. He kissed the \n",
      "countess’ hand and Natasha’s, and sat down beside the \n",
      "sofa. \n",
      "‘It is long since we had the pleasure...’ began the \n",
      "countess, but Prince Andrew interrupted her by answering \n",
      "her intended question, obviously in haste to say what he \n",
      "had to. \n",
      "‘I have not been to see all this time because I have \n",
      "been at my father’s. I had to  talk over a very important \n",
      "matter with him. I only got b ack last night,’ he said \n",
      "glancing at Natasha; ‘I want  to have a talk with you, \n",
      "Countess,’ he added after a moment’s pause. War and Peace  \n",
      "1110 of 2882 \n",
      "The countess lowered her eyes, sighing deeply. \n",
      "‘I am at your disposal,’ she murmured. \n",
      "Natasha knew that she ought to go away, but was \n",
      "unable to do so: something gripped her throat, and \n",
      "regardless of manners she st ared straight at Prince \n",
      "Andrew with wide-open eyes. \n",
      "‘At once? This instant!... No, it can’t be!’ she thought. \n",
      "Again he glanced at her, and that glance convinced her \n",
      "that she was not mistaken. Yes, at once, that very instant, \n",
      "her fate would be decided. \n",
      "‘Go, Natasha! I will call you,’ said the countess in a \n",
      "whisper. \n",
      "Natasha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at \n",
      "Prince Andrew and at her mother and went out. \n",
      "‘I have come, Countess, to  ask for your daughter’s \n",
      "hand,’ said Prince Andrew. \n",
      "The countess’ face flushed hotly, but she said nothing. \n",
      "‘Your offer...’ she began at last sedately. He remained \n",
      "silent, looking into her eyes . ‘Your offer...’ (she grew \n",
      "confused) ‘is agreeable to us, and I accept your offer. I am \n",
      "glad. And my husband... I hope ... but it will depend on \n",
      "her...’ \n",
      "‘I will speak to her when I have your consent.... Do \n",
      "you give it to me?’ said Prince Andrew. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1111 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Yes,’ replied the countess. She held out her hand to \n",
      "him, and with a mixed fee ling of estrangement and \n",
      "tenderness pressed her lips to his forehead as he stooped \n",
      "to kiss her hand. She wished to love him as a son, but felt \n",
      "that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man. ‘I am \n",
      "sure my husband will consent, ’ said the countess, ‘but \n",
      "your father..’ \n",
      "‘My father, to whom I have told my plans, has made it \n",
      "an express condition of his consent that the wedding is not \n",
      "to take place for a year. And I wished to tell you of that,’ \n",
      "said Prince Andrew. \n",
      "‘It is true that Natasha is  still young, but- so long as \n",
      "that?..’ \n",
      "‘It is unavoidable,’ said Prince Andrew with a sigh. \n",
      "‘I will send her to you,’ said the countess, and left the \n",
      "room. \n",
      "‘Lord have mercy upon us !’ she repeated while \n",
      "seeking her daughter. \n",
      "Sonya said that Natasha was in her bedroom. Natasha \n",
      "was sitting on the bed, pale a nd dry eyed, and was gazing \n",
      "at the icons and whispering something as she rapidly \n",
      "crossed herself. Seeing her mother she jumped up and \n",
      "flew to her. \n",
      "‘Well, Mamma?... Well?..’ War and Peace  \n",
      "1112 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Go, go to him. He is asking for your hand,’ said the \n",
      "countess, coldly it seemed to  Natasha. ‘Go... go,’ said the \n",
      "mother, sadly and reproachfully, with a deep sigh, as her \n",
      "daughter ran away. \n",
      "Natasha never remembered how she entered the \n",
      "drawing room. When she came in and saw him she \n",
      "paused. ‘Is it possible that this stranger has now become \n",
      "everything to me?’ she aske d herself, and immediately \n",
      "answered, ‘Yes, everything! He alone is now dearer to me \n",
      "than everything in the world.’ Prince Andrew came up to \n",
      "her with downcast eyes. \n",
      "‘I have loved you from the very first moment I saw \n",
      "you. May I hope?’ \n",
      "He looked at her and was struck by the serious \n",
      "impassioned expression of her face. Her face said: ‘Why \n",
      "ask? Why doubt what you cannot but know? Why speak, \n",
      "when words cannot express what one feels?’ \n",
      "She drew near to him a nd stopped. He took her hand \n",
      "and kissed it. \n",
      "‘Do you love me?’ \n",
      "‘Yes, yes!’ Natasha murmured as if in vexation. Then \n",
      "she sighed loudly and, catching her breath more and more \n",
      "quickly, began to sob. \n",
      "‘What is it? What’s the matter?’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1113 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Oh, I am so happy!’ she replied, smiled through her \n",
      "tears, bent over closer to him,  paused for an instant as if \n",
      "asking herself whether she might, and then kissed him. \n",
      "Prince Andrew held her ha nds, looked into her eyes, \n",
      "and did not find in his heart his former love for her. \n",
      "Something in him had suddenl y changed; there was no \n",
      "longer the former poetic and mystic charm of desire, but \n",
      "there was pity for her femi nine and childish weakness, \n",
      "fear at her devotion and trus tfulness, and an oppressive \n",
      "yet joyful sense of the duty that now bound him to her \n",
      "forever. The present feeling, though not so bright and \n",
      "poetic as the former, was stronger and more serious. \n",
      "‘Did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year?’ \n",
      "asked Prince Andrew, still looking into her eyes. \n",
      "‘Is it possible that I- the ‘c hit of a girl,’ as everybody \n",
      "called me,’ thought Natasha- ‘is it possible that I am now \n",
      "to be the wife and the equal of this strange, dear, clever \n",
      "man whom even my father l ooks up to? Can it be true? \n",
      "Can it be true that there can be no more playing with life, \n",
      "that now I am grown up, that on me now lies a \n",
      "responsibility for my every word and deed? Yes, but what \n",
      "did he ask me?’ \n",
      "‘No,’ she replied, but she had not understood his \n",
      "question. War and Peace  \n",
      "1114 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Forgive me!’ he said. ‘But you are so young, and I \n",
      "have already been through so mu ch in life. I am afraid for \n",
      "you, you do not yet know yourself.’ \n",
      "Natasha listened with concentrated attention, trying but \n",
      "failing to take in the meaning of his words. \n",
      "‘Hard as this year which delays my happiness will be,’ \n",
      "continued Prince Andrew, ‘it will give you time to be sure \n",
      "of yourself. I ask you to make me happy in a year, but you \n",
      "are free: our engagement shall remain a secret, and should \n",
      "you find that you do not love me, or should you come to \n",
      "love...’ said Prince Andrew with an unnatural smile. \n",
      "‘Why do you say that?’ Natasha interrupted him. ‘You \n",
      "know that from the very day you first came to Otradnoe I \n",
      "have loved you,’ she cried, quite convinced that she spoke \n",
      "the truth. \n",
      "‘In a year you will learn to know yourself...’ \n",
      "‘A whole year!’ Natasha repeated suddenly, only now \n",

      "‘But why a year? Why a year?..’ \n",
      "Prince Andrew began to expl ain to her the reasons for \n",
      "this delay. Natasha did not hear him. \n",
      "‘And can’t it be helped?’ she asked. Prince Andrew did \n",
      "not reply, but his face expr essed the impossibility of \n",
      "altering that decision. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1115 of 2882 \n",
      "‘It’s awful! Oh, it’s awful! awful!’ Natasha suddenly \n",
      "cried, and again burst into sobs. ‘I shall die, waiting a \n",
      "year: it’s impossible, it’s awful!’ She looked into her \n",
      "lover’s face and sa w in it a look of commiseration and \n",
      "perplexity. \n",
      "‘No, no! I’ll do anything!’ she said, suddenly checking \n",

      "No betrothal ceremony took place and Natasha’s \n",

      "burden of it; that he ha d given his word and bound \n",
      "himself forever, but that he did not wish to bind Natasha \n",
      "and gave her perfect freedom. If after six months she felt \n",
      "that she did not love him she would have full right to \n",
      "reject him. Naturally neither Natasha nor her parents \n",
      "wished to hear of this, but Prince Andrew was firm. He \n",

      "Natasha as an affianced lover: he did not use the familiar \n",
      "thou, but said you to her, and kissed only her hand. After \n",
      "their engagement, quite diffe rent, intimate, and natural \n",
      "relations sprang up between them. It was as if they had \n",

      "nothing to one another; they felt themselves now quite \n",
      "different beings: then they were artificial, now natural and \n",
      "sincere. At first the family  felt some constraint in \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1117 of 2882 \n",
      "another world, and for a l ong time Natasha trained the \n",

      "he only appeared to be differe nt, but was really just like \n",
      "all of them, and that she was not afraid of him and no one \n",
      "else ought to be. After a few days they grew accustomed \n",

      "usual way of life, in which he took his part. He could talk \n",
      "about rural economy with the count, fashions with the \n",
      "countess and Natasha, and about albums and fancywork \n",
      "with Sonya. Sometimes the household both among \n",

      "how it had all happened, and at the evident omens there \n",
      "had been of it: Prince Andrew’s coming to Otradnoe and \n",
      "their coming to Petersburg, and the likeness between \n",
      "Natasha and Prince Andrew which her nurse had noticed \n",
      "on his first visit, and Andrew ’s encounter with Nicholas \n",
      "in 1805, and many other incident s betokening that it had \n",
      "to be. \n",
      "In the house that poetic du llness and quiet reigned \n",
      "which always accompanies the presence of a betrothed \n",

      "silent. Sometimes the others would get up and go away \n",
      "and the couple, left alone, still remained silent. They \n",
      "rarely spoke of their future life. Prince Andrew was afraid War and Peace  \n",
      "1118 of 2882 \n",
      "and ashamed to speak of it. Natasha shared this as she did \n",
      "all his feelings, which she constantly divined. Once she \n",
      "began questioning him about his son. Prince Andrew \n",
      "blushed, as he often did now- Natasha particularly liked it \n",
      "in him- and said that his son would not live with them. \n",

      "Sometimes the old count would come up, kiss Prince \n",
      "Andrew, and ask his advice about Petya’s education or \n",
      "Nicholas’ service. The old countess sighed as she looked \n",
      "at them; Sonya was always ge tting frightened lest she \n",
      "should be in the way and tried to find excuses for leaving \n",
      "them alone, even when they did not wish it. When Prince \n",
      "Andrew spoke (he could tell a story very well), Natasha \n",
      "listened to him with pride; when she spoke she noticed \n",
      "with fear and joy that he gazed attentively and \n",
      "scrutinizingly at her. She as ked herself in perplexity: \n",
      "‘What does he look for in me? He is trying to discover \n",
      "something by looking at me! What if what he seeks in me \n",
      "is not there?’ Sometimes she fell into one of the mad, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1119 of 2882 \n",
      "merry moods characteristic of her, and then she \n",
      "particularly loved to hear  and see how Prince Andrew \n",
      "laughed. He seldom laughed, but when he did he \n",
      "abandoned himself entirely to his laughter, and after such \n",
      "a laugh she always felt nearer to him. Natasha would have \n",
      "been completely happy if the thought of the separation \n",
      "awaiting her and drawing near had not terrified her, just \n",
      "as the mere thought of it made him turn pale and cold. \n",
      "On the eve of his departure from Petersburg Prince \n",
      "Andrew brought with him Pierre, who had not been to the \n",
      "Rostovs’ once since the ball. Pierre seemed disconcerted \n",
      "and embarrassed. He was talking to the countess, and \n",
      "Natasha sat down beside a litt le chess table with Sonya, \n",

      "‘You have known Bezukhov a long time?’ he asked. \n",
      "‘Do you like him?’ \n",
      "‘Yes, he’s a dear, but very absurd.’ \n",
      "And as usual when speaking of Pierre, she began to tell \n",
      "anecdotes of his absent-mindedness, some of which had \n",

      "rather bad form, but who wa s liked and respected by his \n",
      "comrades, subordinates, and superiors, and was well War and Peace  \n",
      "1136 of 2882 \n",
      "contented with his life. Of  late, in 1809, he found in \n",
      "letters from home more fre quent complaints from his \n",
      "mother that their affairs were falling into greater and \n",
      "greater disorder, and that it was time for him to come \n",
      "back to gladden and comfort his old parents. \n",
      "Reading these letters, Nicholas felt a dread of their \n",
      "wanting to take him away from surroundings in which, \n",
      "protected from all the entanglements of life, he was living \n",
      "so calmly and quietly. He fe lt that sooner or later he \n",
      "would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life, with its \n",
      "embarrassments and affairs to  be straightened out, its \n",
      "accounts with stewards, quarrels, and intrigues, its ties, \n",
      "society, and with Sonya’s love and his promise to her. It \n",
      "was all dreadfully difficult and complicated; and he \n",
      "replied to his mother in cold, formal letters in French, \n",
      "beginning: ‘My dear Mamma,’ and ending: ‘Your \n",
      "obedient son,’ which said nothing of when he would \n",
      "return. In 1810 he received le tters from his parents, in \n",
      "which they told him of Natasha’s engagement to \n",
      "Bolkonski, and that the wedding would be in a year’s time \n",
      "because the old prince made difficulties. This letter \n",
      "grieved and mortified Nicholas . In the first place he was \n",
      "sorry that Natasha, for whom he cared more than for \n",
      "anyone else in the family, should be lost to the home; and \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1137 of 2882 \n",
      "secondly, from his hussar point of view, he regretted not \n",
      "to have been there to show that fellow Bolkonski that \n",
      "connection with him was no su ch great honor after all, \n",
      "and that if he loved Natasha he might dispense with \n",
      "permission from his dotard father. For a moment he \n",
      "hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to \n",
      "see Natasha before she was married, but then came the \n",
      "maneuvers, and considerations about Sonya and about the \n",
      "confusion of their affairs, a nd Nicholas again put it off. \n",
      "But in the spring of that year, he received a letter from his \n",
      "mother, written without his father’s knowledge, and that \n",
      "letter persuaded him to return. She wrote that if he did not \n",
      "come and take matters in hand, their whole property \n",
      "would be sold by auction and they would all have to go \n",
      "begging. The count was so wea k, and trusted Mitenka so \n",
      "much, and was so good-natured, that everybody took \n",
      "advantage of him and things were going from bad to \n",
      "worse. ‘For God’s sake, I implore you, come at once if \n",
      "you do not wish to make me and the whole family \n",
      "wretched,’ wrote the countess. \n",
      "This letter touched Nicholas. He had that common \n",
      "sense of a matter-of-fact man which showed him what he \n",
      "ought to do. War and Peace  \n",
      "1138 of 2882 \n",
      "The right thing now was, if  not to retire from the \n",
      "service, at any rate to go home on leave. Why he had to \n",
      "go he did not know; but after hi s after-dinner nap he gave \n",
      "orders to saddle Mars, an extr emely vicious gray stallion \n",
      "that had not been ridden for a long time, and when he \n",
      "returned with the horse all in a lather, he informed \n",
      "Lavrushka (Denisov’s servant who had remained with \n",
      "him) and his comrades who tu rned up in the evening that \n",
      "he was applying for leave and was going home. Difficult \n",
      "and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would go \n",
      "away without having heard fr om the staff- and this \n",
      "interested him extremely- whether he was promoted to a \n",
      "captaincy or would receive th e Order of St. Anne for the \n",
      "last maneuvers; strange as it was to think that he would go \n",
      "away without having sold his three roans to the Polish \n",
      "Count Golukhovski, who was bargaining for the horses \n",
      "Rostov had betted he would sell for two thousand rubles; \n",
      "incomprehensible as it seemed that the ball the hussars \n",
      "were giving in honor of the Polish Mademoiselle \n",
      "Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to  the Uhlans who had given \n",
      "one in honor of their Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska) \n",
      "would take place without him- he knew he must go away \n",
      "from this good, bright world to somewhere where \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1139 of 2882 \n",
      "obtained his leave. His hussar comrades- not only those of \n",
      "his own regiment, but the w hole brigade- gave Rostov a \n",
      "dinner to which the subscription was fifteen rubles a head, \n",
      "and at which there were tw o bands and two choirs of \n",
      "singers. Rostov danced the Trepak with Major Basov; the \n",
      "tipsy officers tossed, embraced, and dropped Rostov; the \n",
      "soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too, and shouted \n",
      "‘hurrah!’ and then they put him in his sleigh and escorted \n",
      "him as far as the first post station. \n",
      "During the first half of the journey- from Kremenchug \n",
      "to Kiev- all Rostov’s thoughts, as is usual in such cases, \n",
      "were behind him, with the squadron; but when he had \n",
      "gone more than halfway he began to forget his three roans \n",
      "and Dozhoyveyko, his quarter master, and to wonder \n",
      "anxiously how things would be at Otradnoe and what he \n",
      "would find there. Thoughts of  home grew stronger the \n",
      "nearer he approached it- far stronger, as though this \n",
      "feeling of his was subject to the law by which the force of \n",
      "attraction is in inverse propor tion to the square of the \n",
      "distance. At the last post sta tion before Otradnoe he gave \n",
      "the driver a three-ruble tip, and on arriving he ran \n",
      "breathlessly, like a boy, up the steps of his home. \n",
      "After the rapture of meeting,  and after that odd feeling \n",
      "of unsatisfied expectation- th e feeling that ‘everything is War and Peace  \n",
      "1140 of 2882 \n",
      "just the same, so why did I hurry?’- Nicholas began to \n",
      "settle down in his old home world. His father and mother \n",
      "were much the same, only a little older. What was new in \n",
      "them was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord, \n",
      "which there used not to be, and which, as Nicholas soon \n",
      "found out, was due to the bad state of their affairs. Sonya \n",
      "was nearly twenty; she had stopped growing prettier and \n",
      "promised nothing more than she was already, but that was \n",
      "enough. She exhaled happiness and love from the time \n",
      "Nicholas returned, and the faithful, unalterable love of \n",
      "this girl had a gladdening effect on him. Petya and \n",
      "Natasha surprised Nicholas most. Petya was a big \n",
      "handsome boy of thirteen, me rry, witty, and mischievous, \n",
      "with a voice that was alrea dy breaking. As for Natasha, \n",
      "for a long while Nicholas wondered and laughed \n",
      "whenever he looked at her. \n",
      "‘You’re not the same at all,’ he said. \n",
      "‘How? Am I uglier?’ \n",
      "‘On the contrary, but what dignity? A princess!’ he \n",
      "whispered to her. \n",
      "‘Yes, yes, yes!’ cried Natasha, joyfully. \n",
      "She told him about her romance with Prince Andrew \n",
      "and of his visit to Otradnoe and showed him his last letter. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1141 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Well, are you glad?’ Natasha asked. ‘I am so tranquil \n",

      "‘How shall I put it?’ replied Natasha. ‘I was in love \n",
      "with Boris, with my teacher, and with Denisov, but this is \n",
      "quite different. I feel at peace and settled. I know that no \n",
      "better man than he exists, and I am calm and contented \n",
      "now. Not at all as before.’ \n",
      "Nicholas expressed hi s disapproval of the \n",
      "postponement of the marriage for a year; but Natasha \n",
      "attacked her brother with exasperation, proving to him \n",
      "that it could not be otherwis e, and that it would be a bad \n",
      "thing to enter a family agains t the father’s will, and that \n",
      "she herself wished it so. \n",
      "‘You don’t at all understand,’ she said. \n",
      "Nicholas was silent and agreed with her. \n",
      "Her brother often wondered as he looked at her. She \n",
      "did not seem at all like a girl in love and parted from her \n",
      "affianced husband. She was even-tempered and calm and \n",
      "quite as cheerful as of old. This amazed Nicholas and \n",
      "even made him regard Bolkons ki’s courtship skeptically. \n",
      "He could not believe that her fate was sealed, especially \n",
      "as he had not seen her with Prince Andrew. It always War and Peace  \n",
      "1142 of 2882 \n",
      "seemed to him that there was something not quite right \n",
      "about this intended marriage. \n",
      "‘Why this delay? Why no betrothal?’ he thought. \n",
      "Once, when he had touched on this topic with his mother, \n",
      "he discovered, to his surprise and somewhat to his \n",
      "satisfaction, that in the de pth of her soul she too had \n",
      "doubts about this marriage. \n",
      "‘You see he writes,’ said she, showing her son a letter \n",

      "she’s living through the last days of her girlhood, but I \n",

      "and demanded an account of everything. But what an \n",

      "louder, and then words of abuse, dreadful words, \n",
      "ejaculated one after the other. \n",
      "‘Robber!... Ungrateful wretch !... I’ll hack the dog to \n",
      "pieces! I’m not my father!... Robbing us!...’ and so on. \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1144 of 2882 \n",
      "dragged Mitenka out by the scruff of the neck and applied \n",

      "The young count paid no heed to them, but, breathing \n",

      "that now their affairs would certainly improve, but on the \n",
      "other hand felt anxious as to the effect this excitement \n",

      "not meddle in business affairs. But once the countess \n",
      "called her son and informed him that she had a \n",
      "promissory note from Anna Mikhaylovna for two \n",

      "The weather was already gr owing wintry and morning \n",
      "frosts congealed an earth sa turated by autumn rains. The \n",
      "verdure had thickened and its bright green stood out \n",
      "sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye trodden \n",
      "down by the cattle, and against the pale-yellow stubble of \n",
      "the spring buckwheat. The wooded ravines and the \n",
      "copses, which at the end of August had still been green \n",
      "islands amid black fields and stubble, had become golden \n",
      "and bright-red islands amid the green winter rye. The \n",
      "hares had already half change d their summer coats, the \n",
      "fox cubs were beginning to scatter, and the young wolves \n",
      "were bigger than dogs. It was the best time of the year for \n",
      "the chase. The hounds of th at ardent young sportsman \n",
      "Rostov had not merely reached hard winter condition, but \n",
      "were so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was \n",
      "decided to give them a thre e days’ rest and then, on the \n",

      "All that day the hounds remained at home. It was \n",
      "frosty and the air was sharp, but toward evening the sky War and Peace  \n",
      "1148 of 2882 \n",
      "became overcast and it began to thaw. On the fifteenth, \n",
      "when young Rostov, in his dressing gown, looked out of \n",
      "the window, he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for \n",
      "hunting: it was as if the s ky were melting and sinking to \n",
      "the earth without any wind. The only motion in the air \n",
      "was that of the dripping, microscopic particles of \n",
      "drizzling mist. The bare twig s in the garden were hung \n",
      "with transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen \n",
      "leaves. The earth in the kitchen garden looked wet and \n",
      "black and glistened like poppy seed and at a short distance \n",
      "merged into the dull, moist veil of mist. Nicholas went out \n",
      "into the wet and muddy porch. There was a smell of \n",
      "decaying leaves and of dog. Milka, a black-spotted, \n",
      "broad-haunched bitch with prominent black eyes, got up \n",
      "on seeing her master, stretc hed her hind legs, lay down \n",
      "like a hare, and then suddenly jumped up and licked him \n",
      "right on his nose and mustach e. Another borzoi, a dog, \n",
      "catching sight of his master from the garden path, arched \n",
      "his back and, rushing headl ong toward the porch with \n",
      "lifted tail, began rubbing himself against his legs. \n",
      "‘O-hoy!’ came at that moment, that inimitable \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1149 of 2882 \n",
      "with hair cut straight over his forehead, Ukrainian \n",
      "fashion, a long bent whip in his hand, and that look of \n",
      "independence and scorn of everyt hing that is only seen in \n",
      "huntsmen. He doffed his Circassi an cap to his master and \n",
      "looked at him scornfully. This scorn was not offensive to \n",
      "his master. Nicholas knew that  this Daniel, disdainful of \n",
      "everybody and who considered himself above them, was \n",
      "all the same his serf and huntsman. \n",
      "‘Daniel!’ Nicholas said timidly, conscious at the sight \n",
      "of the weather, the hounds, and the huntsman that he was \n",
      "being carried away by that irresistible passion for sport \n",
      "which makes a man forget all his previous resolutions, as \n",
      "a lover forgets in the presence of his mistress. \n",
      "‘What orders, your excellency?’ said the huntsman in \n",

      "hallooing- and two flashing black eyes gazed from under \n",
      "his brows at his master, who was silent. ‘Can you resist \n",

      "‘It’s a good day, eh? For a hunt and a ga llop, eh?’ \n",
      "asked Nicholas, scratching Milka behind the ears. \n",
      "Daniel did not answer, but winked instead. \n",
      "‘I sent Uvarka at dawn to listen,’ his bass boomed out \n",
      "after a minute’s pause. ‘He says she’s moved them into \n",
      "the Otradnoe enclosure. They were howling there.’ (This War and Peace  \n",
      "1150 of 2882 \n",
      "meant that the she-wolf, about whom they both knew, had \n",

      "breaking something in the master’s apartment, and he \n",
      "hastened to say all that was necessary so as to get from \n",

      "flushed, and with quivering ch eeks, drove up with his \n",

      "1158 of 2882 \n",
      "He was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive. \n",

      "with only two or three hounds  giving tongue. He bent \n",
      "down his head and listened, shaking a warning finger at \n",
      "his master. ‘They are on the scent of the cubs... ‘ he \n",

      "The count, forgetting to smooth out the smile on his \n",
      "face, looked into the distance straight before him, down \n",
      "the narrow open space, holding th e snuffbox in his hand \n",
      "but not taking any. After th e cry of the hounds came the \n",
      "deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel’s hunting horn; \n",
      "the pack joined the first th ree hounds and th ey could be \n",
      "heard in full cry, with that peculiar lift in the note that \n",

      "ulyulyu, and above the others ro se Daniel’s voice, now a \n",
      "deep bass, now piercingly shrill. His voice seemed to fill \n",
      "the whole wood and carried fa r beyond out into the open \n",

      "After listening a few moments in silence, the count and \n",
      "his attendant convin ced themselves that the hounds had \n",
      "separated into two packs: th e sound of the larger pack, \n",
      "eagerly giving tongue, began to die away in the distance, \n",

      "1161 of 2882 \n",
      "the other pack rushed by the wood past the count, and it \n",

      "ulyulyu. The sounds of both packs mingled and broke \n",
      "apart again, but both were becoming more distant. \n",
      "Simon sighed and stooped to  straighten the leash a \n",
      "young borzoi had entangled; th e count too sighed and, \n",
      "noticing the snuffbox in his hand, opened it and took a \n",
      "pinch. ‘Back!’ cried Simon to a borzoi that was pushing \n",
      "forward out of the wood. Th e count started and dropped \n",
      "the snuffbox. Nastasya Ivanovna dismounted to pick it up. \n",
      "The count and Simon were looking at him. \n",
      "Then, unexpectedly, as often happens, the sound of the \n",
      "hunt suddenly approached, as if the hounds in full cry and \n",
      "Daniel ulyulyuing were just in front of them. \n",
      "The count turned and saw on his right Mitka staring at \n",
      "him with eyes starting out of his head, raising his cap and \n",
      "pointing before him to the other side. \n",
      "‘Look out!’ he shouted, in a voice plainly showing that \n",
      "he had long fretted to utter that word, and letting the \n",
      "borzois slip he galloped toward the count. \n",
      "The count and Simon galloped out of the wood and \n",
      "saw on their left a wolf which, softly swaying from side to \n",
      "side, was coming at a quiet lope farther to the left to the \n",
      "very place where they were standing. The angry borzois War and Peace  \n",
      "1162 of 2882 \n",
      "whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the \n",

      "The wolf paused, turned its heavy forehead toward the \n",
      "dogs awkwardly, like a man suffering from the quinsy, \n",
      "and, still slightly swaying from side to side, gave a couple \n",
      "of leaps and with a swish of its tail disappeared into the \n",
      "skirt of the wood. At the same instant, with a cry like a \n",
      "wail, first one hound, then another, and then another, \n",
      "sprang helter-skelter from the wood opposite and the \n",
      "whole pack rushed across the field toward the very spot \n",
      "where the wolf had disappeared. The hazel bushes parted \n",
      "behind the hounds and Daniel’s chestnut horse appeared, \n",
      "dark with sweat. On its long back sat Daniel, hunched \n",

      "his flushed, perspiring face. \n",
      "‘Ulyulyulyu! ulyulyu!...’ he  cried. When he caught \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1163 of 2882 \n",
      "schoolboy, looked round, trying by a smile to win \n",
      "Simon’s sympathy for his plight. But Simon was no \n",
      "longer there. He was gallopi ng round by the bushes while \n",
      "the field was coming up on both sides, all trying to head \n",

      "Nicholas Rostov meanwhile remained at his post, \n",
      "waiting for the wolf. By the way the hunt approached and \n",
      "receded, by the cries of the dogs whose notes were \n",
      "familiar to him, by the way the voices of the huntsmen \n",
      "approached, receded, and rose, he realized what was \n",
      "happening at the copse. He  knew that young and old \n",
      "wolves were there, that the hounds had separated into two \n",
      "packs, that somewhere a wolf was being chased, and that \n",
      "something had gone wrong. He expected the wolf to come \n",
      "his way any moment. He made  thousands of different \n",
      "conjectures as to where and from what side the beast \n",
      "would come and how he would set upon it. Hope \n",
      "alternated with despair. Se veral times he addressed a \n",
      "prayer to God that the wolf should come his way. He \n",
      "prayed with that passionate and shame-faced feeling with \n",
      "which men pray at moments of  great excitement arising \n",
      "from trivial causes. ‘What would it be to Thee to do this \n",
      "for me?’ he said to God. ‘I know Thou art great, and that \n",
      "it is a sin to ask this of Thee,  but for God’s sake do let the \n",
      "old wolf come my way and let Karay spring at it- in sight \n",
      "of ‘Uncle’ who is watching from over there- and seize it \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1165 of 2882 \n",
      "by the throat in a death grip!’ A thousand times during \n",
      "that half-hour Rostov cast ea ger and restless glances over \n",
      "the edge of the wood, with the two scraggy oaks rising \n",
      "above the aspen undergrowth and the gully with its water-\n",
      "worn side and ‘Uncle’s’ cap just visible above the bush on \n",
      "his right. \n",
      "‘No, I shan’t have such luck,’ thought Rostov, ‘yet \n",
      "what wouldn’t it be worth! It is not to be! Everywhere, at \n",
      "cards and in war, I am always unlucky.’ Memories of \n",
      "Austerlitz and of Dolokhov fl ashed rapidly and clearly \n",
      "through his mind. ‘Only once in  my life to get an old \n",
      "wolf, I want only that!’ thought he, straining eyes and ears \n",
      "and looking to the left and th en to the right and listening \n",
      "to the slightest variation of note in the cries of the dogs. \n",
      "Again he looked to the right and saw something \n",
      "running toward him across the deserted field. ‘No, it can’t \n",
      "be!’ thought Rostov, taking a de ep breath, as a man does \n",
      "at the coming of something long hoped for. The height of \n",
      "happiness was reached- and so simply, without warning, \n",
      "or noise, or display, that Rostov could not believe his eyes \n",
      "and remained in doubt for over a second. The wolf ran \n",
      "forward and jumped heavily over a gully that lay in her \n",
      "path. She was an old animal with a gray back and big \n",
      "reddish belly. She ran without  hurry, evidently feeling War and Peace  \n",
      "1166 of 2882 \n",
      "sure that no one saw her. Rostov, holding his breath, \n",
      "looked round at the borzois. They stood or lay not seeing \n",
      "the wolf or understanding th e situation. Old Karay had \n",
      "turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas, baring \n",
      "his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs. \n",
      "‘Ulyulyulyu!’ whispered Rostov, pouting his lips. The \n",
      "borzois jumped up, jerking th e rings of the leashes and \n",
      "pricking their ears. Karay finished scratching his \n",
      "hindquarters and, cocking his ears, got up with quivering \n",
      "tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down. \n",
      "‘Shall I loose them or not?’ Nicholas asked himself as \n",
      "the wolf approached him coming from the copse. \n",
      "Suddenly the wolf’s whole physiognomy changed: she \n",
      "shuddered, seeing what she had probably never seen \n",
      "before- human eyes fixed upon her- and turning her head \n",
      "a little toward Rostov, she paused. \n",
      "‘Back or forward? Eh, no matter, forward...’ the wolf \n",
      "seemed to say to herself, and she moved forward without \n",
      "again looking round and with  a quiet, long, easy yet \n",
      "resolute lope. \n",
      "‘Ulyulyu!’ cried Nicholas, in a voice not his own, and \n",
      "of its own accord his good horse darted headlong \n",
      "downhill, leaping over gullies to head off the wolf, and \n",
      "the borzois passed it, running fast er still. Nicholas did not \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1167 of 2882 \n",
      "hear his own cry nor feel th at he was galloping, nor see \n",
      "the borzois, nor the ground over which he went: he saw \n",
      "only the wolf, who, increasing her speed, bounded on in \n",
      "the same direction along the hollow. The first to come \n",
      "into view was Milka, with her black markings and \n",
      "powerful quarters, gaining upon the wolf. Nearer and \n",
      "nearer... now she was ahead of it; but the wolf turned its \n",
      "head to face her, and instead  of putting on  speed as she \n",
      "usually did Milka suddenly ra ised her tail and stiffened \n",
      "her forelegs. \n",
      "‘Ulyulyulyulyu!’ shouted Nicholas. \n",
      "The reddish Lyubim rushed forward from behind \n",
      "Milka, sprang impetuously at the wolf, and seized it by its \n",
      "hindquarters, but immediately jumped aside in terror. The \n",
      "wolf crouched, gnashed her teeth, and again rose and \n",
      "bounded forward, followed at the distance of a couple of \n",
      "feet by all the borzois, who did not get any closer to her. \n",
      "‘She’ll get away! No, it’s impossible!’ thought \n",
      "Nicholas, still shouting with a hoarse voice. \n",
      "‘Karay, ulyulyu!...’ he shouted, looking round for the \n",
      "old borzoi who was now his only hope. Karay, with all \n",
      "the strength age had left him, stretched himself to the \n",
      "utmost and, watching the wolf , galloped heavily aside to \n",
      "intercept it. But the quickness of the wolf’s lope and the \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1168 of 2882 \n",
      "borzoi’s slower pace made  it plain that Karay had \n",
      "miscalculated. Nicholas could already see not far in front \n",
      "of him the wood where the wolf would certainly escape \n",
      "should she reach it. But, coming toward him, he saw \n",
      "hounds and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the \n",
      "wolf. There was still hope. A long, yellowish young \n",
      "borzoi, one Nicholas did not know, from another leash, \n",
      "rushed impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost \n",
      "knocked her over. But the wolf jumped up more quickly \n",
      "than anyone could have expect ed and, gnashing her teeth, \n",
      "flew at the yellowish borzoi, which, with a piercing yelp, \n",
      "fell with its head on the ground, bleeding from a gash in \n",
      "its side. \n",
      "‘Karay? Old fellow!...’ wailed Nicholas. \n",
      "Thanks to the delay caused  by this crossing of the \n",
      "wolf’s path, the old dog with its felted hair hanging from \n",
      "its thigh was within five paces of it. As if aware of her \n",
      "danger, the wolf turned her eyes on Karay, tucked her tail \n",
      "yet further between her legs, and increased her speed. But \n",
      "here Nicholas only saw that something happened to \n",
      "Karay- the borzoi was suddenl y on the wolf, and they \n",
      "rolled together down into a gully just in front of them. \n",
      "That instant, when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in \n",
      "the gully with the dogs, while from under them could be \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1169 of 2882 \n",
      "seen her gray hair and outstretched hind leg and her \n",
      "frightened choking head, with her ears laid back (Karay \n",
      "was pinning her by the throat), was the happiest moment \n",
      "of his life. With his hand on his saddlebow, he was ready \n",
      "to dismount and stab the wolf, when she suddenly thrust \n",
      "her head up from among that mass of dogs, and then her \n",
      "forepaws were on the edge of the gully. She clicked her \n",
      "teeth (Karay no longer had her by the throat), leaped with \n",
      "a movement of her hind legs  out of the gully, and having \n",
      "disengaged herself from the dogs, with tail tucked in \n",
      "again, went forward. Karay, his hair bristling, and \n",
      "probably bruised or wounded, cl imbed with difficulty out \n",
      "of the gully. \n",
      "‘Oh my God! Why?’ Nicholas cried in despair. \n",
      "‘Uncle’s’ huntsman was galloping from the other side \n",
      "across the wolf’s path and his borzois once more stopped \n",
      "the animal’s advance. She was again hemmed in. \n",
      "Nicholas and his attendant , with ‘Uncle’ and his \n",
      "huntsman, were all riding round the wolf, crying \n",
      "‘ulyulyu!’ shouting and preparing to dismount each \n",
      "moment that the wolf crouched back, and starting forward \n",
      "again every time she shook he rself and moved toward the \n",
      "wood where she would be safe. War and Peace  \n",
      "1170 of 2882 \n",
      "Already, at the beginning of this chase, Daniel, hearing \n",
      "the ulyulyuing, had rushed out from the wood. He saw \n",
      "Karay seize the wolf, and checked his horse, supposing \n",
      "the affair to be over. But when he saw that the horsemen \n",
      "did not dismount and that th e wolf shook herself and ran \n",
      "for safety, Daniel set his ch estnut galloping, not at the \n",
      "wolf but straight toward the wood, just as Karay had run \n",
      "to cut the animal off. As a result of this, he galloped up to \n",
      "the wolf just when she had been stopped a second time by \n",
      "‘Uncle’s’ borzois. \n",
      "Daniel galloped up silently, holding a naked dagger in \n",
      "his left hand and thrashing the laboring sides of his \n",
      "chestnut horse with his whip as if it were a flail. \n",
      "Nicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the \n",
      "chestnut, breathing heavily, panted past him, and he heard \n",
      "the fall of a body and saw Daniel lying on the wolf’s back \n",
      "among the dogs, trying to seize her by the ears. It was \n",
      "evident to the dogs, the hunters, and to the wolf herself \n",
      "that all was now over. The terr ified wolf pressed back her \n",
      "ears and tried to rise, but the borzois stuck to her. Daniel \n",
      "rose a little, took a step, and with his whole weight, as if \n",
      "lying down to rest, fell on the wolf, seizing her by the \n",
      "ears. Nicholas was about to  stab her, but Daniel \n",
      "whispered, ‘Don’t! We’ll gag her!’ and, changing his \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1171 of 2882 \n",
      "position, set his foot on the wolf’s neck. A stick was \n",
      "thrust between her jaws and she was fastened with a \n",
      "leash, as if bridled, her legs were bound together, and \n",
      "Daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to side. \n",
      "With happy, exhausted faces, they laid the old wolf, \n",
      "alive, on a shying and snor ting horse and, accompanied \n",
      "by the dogs yelping at her, t ook her to the place where \n",
      "they were all to meet. The hounds had killed two of the \n",
      "cubs and the borzois three. The huntsmen assembled with \n",
      "their booty and their stories, and all came to look at the \n",
      "wolf, which, with her broad-browed head hanging down \n",
      "and the bitten stick between her jaws, gazed with great \n",
      "glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding \n",
      "her. When she was touched, she jerked her bound legs and \n",
      "looked wildly yet simply at everybody. Old Count Rostov \n",
      "also rode up and touched the wolf. \n",
      "‘Oh, what a formidable one!’  said he. ‘A formidable \n",
      "one, eh?’ he asked Daniel, who was standing near. \n",
      "‘Yes, your excellency,’ answered Daniel, quickly \n",
      "doffing his cap. \n",
      "The count remembered the wolf  he had let slip and his \n",
      "encounter with Daniel. \n",
      "‘Ah, but you are a crusty fellow, friend!’ said the \n",
      "count. War and Peace  \n",
      "1172 of 2882 \n",
      "For sole reply Daniel gave  him a shy, childlike, meek, \n",

      "The old count went home, and Natasha and Petya \n",
      "promised to return very soon, but as it was still early the \n",
      "hunt went farther. At midday they put the hounds into a \n",
      "ravine thickly overgrown w ith young trees. Nicholas \n",
      "standing in a fallow field could see all his whips. \n",
      "Facing him lay a field of winter rye, there his own \n",
      "huntsman stood alone in a hollow behind a hazel bush. \n",
      "The hounds had scarcely been loosed before Nicholas \n",
      "heard one he knew, Voltorn, gi ving tongue at intervals; \n",
      "other hounds joined in, now pausing and now again \n",
      "giving tongue. A moment late r he heard a cry from the \n",
      "wooded ravine that a fox ha d been found, and the whole \n",
      "pack, joining together, rushed along the ravine toward the \n",
      "ryefield and away from Nicholas. \n",
      "He saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the \n",
      "edge of the ravine, he even saw the hounds, and was \n",
      "expecting a fox to show its elf at any moment on the \n",
      "ryefield opposite. \n",
      "The huntsman standing in the hollow moved and \n",
      "loosed his borzois, and Ni cholas saw a queer, short-\n",
      "legged red fox with a fine brush going hard across the War and Peace  \n",
      "1174 of 2882 \n",
      "field. The borzois bore down on it.... Now they drew close \n",
      "to the fox which began to dodge between the field in \n",
      "sharper and sharper curves, trailing its brush, when \n",
      "suddenly a strange white borzo i dashed in followed by a \n",
      "black one, and everything was in confusion; the borzois \n",
      "formed a star-shaped figure, scarcely swaying their bodies \n",
      "and with tails turned away from the center of the group. \n",
      "Two huntsmen galloped up to the dogs; one in a red cap, \n",
      "the other, a stranger, in a green coat. \n",
      "‘What’s this?’ thought Nicholas. ‘Where’s that \n",
      "huntsman from? He is not ‘Uncle’s’ man.’ \n",
      "The huntsmen got the fox, but  stayed there a long time \n",
      "without strapping it to the saddle. Their horses, bridled \n",
      "and with high saddles, stood ne ar them and there too the \n",
      "dogs were lying. The huntsmen waved their arms and did \n",
      "something to the fox. Then from that spot came the sound \n",
      "of a horn, with the signal agreed on in case of a fight. \n",
      "‘That’s Ilagin’s huntsman having a row with our Ivan,’ \n",
      "said Nicholas’ groom. \n",
      "Nicholas sent the man to call Natasha and Petya to \n",
      "him, and rode at a footpace to the place where the whips \n",
      "were getting the hounds together. Several of the field \n",
      "galloped to the spot where the fight was going on. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1175 of 2882 \n",
      "Nicholas dismounted, and with Natasha and Petya, \n",
      "who had ridden up, stopped near the hounds, waiting to \n",
      "see how the matter would end. Out of the bushes came the \n",
      "huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward his \n",
      "young master, with the fox tied to his crupper. While still \n",
      "at a distance he took off his cap and tried to speak \n",
      "respectfully, but he was pale  and breathless and his face \n",
      "was angry. One of his eyes  was black, but he probably \n",
      "was not even aware of it. \n",
      "‘What has happened?’ asked Nicholas. \n",
      "‘A likely thing, killing a fox our dogs had hunted! And \n",
      "it was my gray bitch that caught it! Go to law, indeed!... \n",
      "He snatches at the fox! I ga ve him one with the fox. Here \n",
      "it is on my saddle! Do you want a taste of this?...’ said the \n",
      "huntsman, pointing to his dagger and probably imagining \n",
      "himself still speaking to his foe. \n",
      "Nicholas, not stopping to talk to the man, asked his \n",
      "sister and Petya to wait for him and rode to the spot where \n",
      "the enemy’s, Ilagin’s, hunting party was. \n",
      "The victorious huntsman rode off to join the field, and \n",
      "there, surrounded by inquiring  sympathizers, recounted \n",
      "his exploits. \n",
      "The facts were that Ilagin, with whom the Rostovs had \n",
      "a quarrel and were at law, hunted over places that War and Peace  \n",
      "1176 of 2882 \n",
      "belonged by custom to the Ro stovs, and had now, as if \n",
      "purposely, sent his men to the very woods the Rostovs \n",
      "were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had \n",
      "chased. \n",
      "Nicholas, though he had neve r seen Ilagin, with his \n",
      "usual absence of moderation in judgment, hated him \n",
      "cordially from reports of hi s arbitrariness and violence, \n",
      "and regarded him as his bitterest foe. He rode in angry \n",
      "agitation toward him, firmly grasping his whip and fully \n",
      "prepared to take the most re solute and desperate steps to \n",
      "punish his enemy. \n",
      "Hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a \n",
      "stout gentleman in a beaver cap came riding toward him \n",
      "on a handsome raven-black horse, accompanied by two \n",

      "Instead of an enemy, Nicholas  found in Ilagin a stately \n",
      "and courteous gentleman who wa s particularly anxious to \n",
      "make the young count’s acquaintance. Having ridden up \n",
      "to Nicholas, Ilagin raised his beaver cap and said he much \n",
      "regretted what had occurre d and would have the man \n",
      "punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted \n",
      "by someone else’s borzois. He hoped to become better \n",
      "acquainted with the count a nd invited him to draw his \n",

      "1177 of 2882 \n",
      "Natasha, afraid that her brother would do something \n",
      "dreadful, had followed him in some excitement. Seeing \n",
      "the enemies exchanging friendl y greetings, she rode up to \n",
      "them. Ilagin lifted his beaver cap still higher to Natasha \n",
      "and said, with a pleasant smile, that the young countess \n",
      "resembled Diana in her passion for the chase as well as in \n",
      "her beauty, of which he had heard much. \n",
      "To expiate his huntsman’s o ffense, Ilagin pressed the \n",
      "Rostovs to come to an upla nd of his about a mile away \n",
      "which he usually kept for himself and which, he said, \n",
      "swarmed with hares. Nichol as agreed, and the hunt, now \n",
      "doubled, moved on. \n",
      "The way to Iligin’s upland was across the fields. The \n",
      "hunt servants fell into line. The masters rode together. \n",
      "‘Uncle,’ Rostov, and Ilagin kept stealthily glancing at one \n",
      "another’s dogs, trying not  to be observed by their \n",
      "companions and searching uneasily for rivals to their own \n",
      "borzois. \n",
      "Rostov was particularly stru ck by the beauty of a \n",
      "small, pure-bred, red-spotte d bitch on Ilag in’s leash, \n",
      "slender but with muscles like steel, a delicate muzzle, and \n",
      "prominent black eyes. He had heard of the swiftness of \n",
      "Ilagin’s borzois, and in that beautiful bitch saw a rival to \n",
      "his own Milka. War and Peace  \n",
      "1178 of 2882 \n",
      "In the middle of a sober c onversation begun by Ilagin \n",
      "about the year’s harvest, Ni cholas pointed to the red-\n",
      "spotted bitch. \n",
      "‘A fine little bitch, that!’ said he in a careless tone. ‘Is \n",
      "she swift?’ \n",
      "‘That one? Yes, she’s a good dog, gets what she’s \n",
      "after,’ answered Ilagin indi fferently, of the red-spotted \n",
      "bitch Erza, for which, a year before, he had given a \n",
      "neighbor three families of house serfs. ‘So in your parts, \n",
      "too, the harvest is nothing to boast of, Count?’ he went \n",
      "on, continuing the conversation they had begun. And \n",
      "considering it polite to return the young count’s \n",

      "Milka who attracted his attention by her breadth. ‘That \n",
      "black-spotted one of yours is fine- well shaped!’ said he. \n",
      "‘Yes, she’s fast enough,’ replied Nicholas, and \n",
      "thought: ‘If only a full-grown ha re would cross the field \n",
      "now I’d show you what sort of borzoi she is,’ and turning \n",
      "to his groom, he said he would give a ruble to anyone \n",
      "who found a hare. \n",
      "‘I don’t understand,’ conti nued Ilagin, ‘how some \n",

      "myself, I can tell you, Count, I enjoy riding in company \n",
      "such as this... what could be  better?’ (he again raised his \n",

      "‘How can I join in? Why, you’ve given a village for \n",

      "‘Rugay, hey, hey!’ he shouted. ‘Rugayushka!’ he \n",
      "added, involuntarily by this diminutive expressing his \n",
      "affection and the hopes he placed on this red borzoi. \n",
      "Natasha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly men \n",

      "The huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up \n",

      "But before the whip could reply, the hare, scenting the \n",
      "frost coming next morning, was unable to rest and leaped \n",
      "up. The pack on leash rushed downhill in full cry after the \n",

      "darted after the hounds and the hare. All the hunt, who \n",

      "the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight \n",
      "even for an instant of the chase. The hare they had started \n",
      "was a strong and swift one. When he jumped up he did \n",

      "shouting and trampling that resounded from all sides at \n",
      "once. He took a dozen bounds, not very quickly, letting \n",
      "the borzois gain on him, a nd, finally having chosen his \n",
      "direction and realized his da nger, laid back his ears and \n",
      "rushed off headlong. He had been lying in the stubble, but \n",
      "in front of him was the autumn sowing where the ground \n",
      "was soft. The two borzois of the huntsman who had \n",
      "sighted him, having been the nearest, were the first to see \n",
      "and pursue him, but they had not  gone far before Ilagin’s \n",
      "red-spotted Erza passed them, got  within a length, flew at \n",
      "the hare with terrible swiftn ess aiming at his scut, and, \n",
      "thinking she had seized him,  rolled over like a ball. The \n",
      "hare arched his back and bounded off yet more swiftly. \n",
      "From behind Erza rushed the broad-haunched, black-\n",
      "spotted Milka and began rapidly gaining on the hare. War and Peace  \n",
      "1182 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Milashka, dear!’ rose Nicholas’ triumphant cry. It \n",
      "looked as if Milka would immediately pounce on the hare, \n",
      "but she overtook him and fl ew past. The hare had \n",
      "squatted. Again the beautiful Erza reached him, but when \n",
      "close to the hare’s scut pa used as if measuring the \n",
      "distance, so as not to make a mistake this time but seize \n",
      "his hind leg. \n",
      "‘Erza, darling! Ilagin wailed in a voice unlike his own. \n",
      "Erza did not hearken to his appeal. At the very moment \n",
      "when she would have seized her prey, the hare moved and \n",
      "darted along the balk betw een the winter rye and the \n",
      "stubble. Again Erza and Milka were abreast, running like \n",
      "a pair of carriage horses, a nd began to overtake the hare, \n",
      "but it was easier for the hare  to run on the balk and the \n",
      "borzois did not overtake him so quickly. \n",
      "‘Rugay, Rugayushka! That’s it, come on!’ came a third \n",
      "voice just then, and ‘Uncle’s’ red borzoi, straining and \n",
      "curving its back, caught up with the two foremost borzois, \n",
      "pushed ahead of them regardless  of the terrible strain, put \n",
      "on speed close to the hare, knocked it off the balk onto the \n",
      "ryefield, again put on speed st ill more viciously, sinking \n",
      "to his knees in the muddy field, and all one could see was \n",
      "how, muddying his back, he rolled over with the hare. A \n",
      "ring of borzois surrounded hi m. A moment later everyone \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1183 of 2882 \n",
      "had drawn up round the crowd of dogs. Only the \n",
      "delighted ‘Uncle’ dismounted, and cut off a pad, shaking \n",
      "the hare for the blood to drip off, and anxiously glancing \n",
      "round with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched. \n",
      "He spoke without himself knowing whom to or what \n",
      "about. ‘That’s it, come on! Th at’s a dog!... There, it has \n",
      "beaten them all, the thousand-ruble as well as the one-\n",
      "ruble borzois. That’s it, come  on!’ said he, panting and \n",
      "looking wrathfully around as if he were abusing someone, \n",
      "as if they were all his enem ies and had insulted him, and \n",
      "only now had he at last succeeded in justifying himself. \n",
      "‘There are your thousand-rubl e ones.... That’s it, come \n",
      "on!..’ \n",
      "‘Rugay, here’s a pad for you!’ he said, throwing down \n",
      "the hare’s muddy pad. ‘You’ve deserved it, that’s it, come \n",
      "on!’ \n",
      "‘She’d tired herself out, she’d run it down three times \n",
      "by herself,’ said Nicholas, also not listening to anyone \n",
      "and regardless of whether he were heard or not. \n",
      "‘But what is there in running across it like that?’ said \n",
      "Ilagin’s groom. \n",
      "‘Once she had missed it and turned it away, any \n",
      "mongrel could take it,’ Ilagin was saying at the same time, \n",
      "breathless from his gallop and his excitement. At the same War and Peace  \n",
      "1184 of 2882 \n",
      "moment Natasha, without drawing breath, screamed \n",
      "joyously, ecstatically, and so  piercingly that it set \n",
      "everyone’s ear tingling. By that shriek she expressed what \n",
      "the others expressed by all talking at once, and it was so \n",
      "strange that she must hersel f have been ashamed of so \n",
      "wild a cry and everyone else would have been amazed at \n",
      "it at any other time. ‘Uncle’ himself twisted up the hare, \n",
      "threw it neatly and smartly across his horse’s back as if by \n",
      "that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody, and, with an \n",
      "air of not wishing to speak to anyone, mounted his bay \n",
      "and rode off. The others all followed, dispirited and \n",
      "shamefaced, and only much later were they able to regain \n",
      "their former affectation of indifference. For a long time \n",
      "they continued to look at re d Rugay who, his arched back \n",
      "spattered with mud and clan king the ring of his leash, \n",
      "walked along just behind ‘Unc le’s’ horse with the serene \n",
      "air of a conqueror. \n",

      "appearance seem to Nicholas to be saying. \n",
      "When, much later, ‘Uncle’ rode up to Nicholas and \n",
      "began talking to him, he felt flattered that, after what had \n",
      "happened, ‘Uncle’ deigned to speak to him. \n",

      "Chapter VII \n",
      "Toward evening Ilagin t ook leave of Nicholas, who \n",
      "found that they were so far from home that he accepted \n",
      "‘Uncle’s’ offer that the hunting party should spend the \n",
      "night in his little village of Mikhaylovna. \n",
      "‘And if you put up at my house that will be better still. \n",
      "That’s it, come on!’ said ‘Uncle.’ ‘You see it’s damp \n",
      "weather, and you could rest, a nd the little countess could \n",
      "be driven home in a trap.’ \n",
      "‘Uncle’s’ offer was accepted. A huntsman was sent to \n",
      "Otradnoe for a trap, while Nicholas rode with Natasha and \n",
      "Petya to ‘Uncle’s’ house. \n",
      "Some five male domestic se rfs, big and little, rushed \n",
      "out to the front porch to m eet their master. A score of \n",
      "women serfs, old and young, as well as children, popped \n",
      "out from the back entrance to  have a look at the hunters \n",
      "who were arriving. The presen ce of Natasha- a woman, a \n",
      "lady, and on horseback- raised th e curiosity of the serfs to \n",
      "such a degree that many of them came up to her, stared \n",
      "her in the face, and unabashed by her presence made \n",
      "remarks about her as though she were some prodigy on War and Peace  \n",
      "1186 of 2882 \n",
      "show and not a human being able to hear or understand \n",
      "what was said about her. \n",
      "‘Arinka! Look, she sits side ways! There she sits and \n",
      "her skirt dangles.... See, she’s got a little hunting horn!’ \n",
      "‘Goodness gracious! See her knife?..’ \n",
      "‘Isn’t she a Tartar!’ \n",
      "‘How is it you didn’t go head over heels?’ asked the \n",
      "boldest of all, addressing Natasha directly. \n",
      "‘Uncle’ dismounted at the po rch of his little wooden \n",
      "house which stood in the midst of an overgrown garden \n",
      "and, after a glance at his retain ers, shouted authoritatively \n",
      "that the superfluous ones should take themselves off and \n",
      "that all necessary preparations  should be made to receive \n",
      "the guests and the visitors. \n",
      "The serfs all dispersed. ‘Unc le’ lifted Natasha off her \n",
      "horse and taking her hand led her up the rickety wooden \n",
      "steps of the porch. The house, with its bare, unplastered \n",
      "log walls, was not overclean- it did not seem that those \n",
      "living in it aimed at keeping it  spotless- but neither was it \n",
      "noticeably neglected. In the entry there was a smell of \n",
      "fresh apples, and wolf and fox skins hung about. \n",
      "‘Uncle’ led the visitors through the anteroom into a \n",
      "small hall with a folding table and red chairs, then into the \n",
      "drawing room with a round birchwood table and a sofa, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1187 of 2882 \n",
      "and finally into his private room where there was a \n",
      "tattered sofa, a worn carpet, and portraits of Suvorov, of \n",
      "the host’s father and mother, and of himself in military \n",
      "uniform. The study smelt str ongly of tobacco and dogs. \n",
      "‘Uncle’ asked his visitors  to sit down and make \n",
      "themselves at home, and then went out of the room. \n",
      "Rugay, his back still muddy, cam e into the room and lay \n",
      "down on the sofa, cleaning himself with his tongue and \n",
      "teeth. Leading from the study was a passage in which a \n",
      "partition with ragged curtains could be seen. From behind \n",
      "this came women’s laughter and whispers. Natasha, \n",
      "Nicholas, and Petya took off their wraps and sat down on \n",
      "the sofa. Petya, leaning on his elbow, fell asleep at once. \n",
      "Natasha and Nicholas were silent. Their faces glowed, \n",
      "they were hungry and very cheerful. They looked at one \n",
      "another (now that the hunt wa s over and they were in the \n",
      "house, Nicholas no longer considered it necessary to show \n",
      "his manly superiority over his sister), Natasha gave him a \n",
      "wink, and neither refrained long from bursting into a peal \n",
      "of ringing laughter even before they had a pretext ready to \n",
      "account for it. \n",
      "After a while ‘Uncle’ came in, in a Cossack coat, blue \n",
      "trousers, and small top boots. And Natasha felt that this \n",
      "costume, the very one she had regarded with surprise and War and Peace  \n",
      "1188 of 2882 \n",
      "amusement at Otradnoe, was just the right thing and not at \n",
      "all worse than a swallow-tail  or frock coat. ‘Uncle’ too \n",
      "was in high spirits and far from being offended by the \n",
      "brother’s and sister’s laughter  (it could never enter his \n",
      "head that they might be laughing at his way of life) he \n",
      "himself joined in the merriment. \n",
      "‘That’s right, young countess,  that’s it, come on! I \n",
      "never saw anyone like her!’ sa id he, offering Nicholas a \n",
      "pipe with a long stem and, with a practiced motion of \n",
      "three fingers, taking down another that had been cut short. \n",
      "‘She’s ridden all day like a man, and is as fresh as ever! \n",
      "Soon after ‘Uncle’s’ reappearance the door was \n",
      "opened, evidently from the sound by a barefooted girl, \n",
      "and a stout, rosy, good-looking woman of about forty, \n",
      "with a double chin and full red lips, entered carrying a \n",
      "large loaded tray. With hospitable dignity and cordiality \n",
      "in her glance and in every motion, she looked at the \n",
      "visitors and, with a pleasan t smile, bowed respectfully. In \n",
      "spite of her exceptional stoutness, which caused her to \n",
      "protrude her chest and stomach and throw back her head, \n",
      "this woman (who was ‘Uncle’s ’ housekeeper) trod very \n",
      "lightly. She went to the table, set down the tray, and with \n",
      "her plump white hands deftly took from it the bottles and \n",
      "various hors d’oeuvres and dishes and arranged them on \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1189 of 2882 \n",
      "the table. When she had finished, she stepped aside and \n",
      "stopped at the door with a smile on her face. ‘Here I am. I \n",
      "am she! Now do you understa nd ‘Uncle’?’ her expression \n",
      "said to Rostov. How could one  help understanding? Not \n",
      "only Nicholas, but even Natasha understood the meaning \n",
      "of his puckered brow and the happy complacent smile that \n",
      "slightly puckered his lip s when Anisya Fedorovna \n",
      "entered. On the tray was a bot tle of herb wine, different \n",
      "kinds of vodka, pickled mushro oms, rye cakes made with \n",
      "buttermilk, honey in the comb, still mead and sparkling \n",
      "mead, apples, nuts (raw and roasted), and nut-and-honey \n",
      "sweets. Afterwards she brought a freshly roasted chicken, \n",
      "ham, preserves made with honey, and preserves made \n",
      "with sugar. \n",
      "All this was the fruit of Anisya Fedorovna’s \n",
      "housekeeping, gathered and prepared by her. The smell \n",
      "and taste of it all had a smack of Anisya Fedorovna \n",
      "herself: a savor of juicine ss, cleanliness, whiteness, and \n",
      "pleasant smiles. \n",
      "‘Take this, little Lady-Count ess!’ she kept saying, as \n",
      "she offered Natasha first one thing and then another. \n",
      "Natasha ate of everything and thought she had never \n",
      "seen or eaten such buttermilk cakes, such aromatic jam, War and Peace  \n",
      "1190 of 2882 \n",
      "such honey-and-nut sweets, or such a chicken anywhere. \n",
      "Anisya Fedorovna left the room. \n",
      "After supper, over their ch erry brandy, Rostov and \n",
      "‘Uncle’ talked of past and future hunts, of Rugay and \n",
      "Ilagin’s dogs, while Natasha sat upright on the sofa and \n",
      "listened with sparkling eyes. She tried several times to \n",
      "wake Petya that he might eat something, but he only \n",
      "muttered incoherent words without waking up. Natasha \n",
      "felt so lighthearted and happy in these novel surroundings \n",
      "that she only feared the trap would come for her too soon. \n",
      "After a casual pause, such as often occurs when receiving \n",
      "friends for the first time in one’s own house, ‘Uncle,’ \n",
      "answering a thought that was in his visitors’ mind, said: \n",
      "‘This, you see, is how I am  finishing my days... Death \n",
      "will come. That’s it, come on! Nothing will remain. Then \n",
      "why harm anyone?’ \n",
      "‘Uncle’s’ face was very significant and even handsome \n",
      "as he said this. Involuntarily  Rostov recalled all the good \n",
      "he had heard about him from his father and the neighbors. \n",
      "Throughout the whole province ‘Uncle’ had the \n",
      "reputation of being the most  honorable and disinterested \n",
      "of cranks. They called him in to decide family disputes, \n",
      "chose him as executor, confided secrets to him, elected \n",
      "him to be a justice and to other posts; but he always \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1191 of 2882 \n",
      "persistently refused public  appointments, passing the \n",
      "autumn and spring in the fields on his bay gelding, sitting \n",
      "at home in winter, and lying in his overgrown garden in \n",
      "summer. \n",
      "‘Why don’t you enter the service, Uncle?’ \n",
      "‘I did once, but gave it up. I am not fit for it. That’s it, \n",
      "come on! I can’t make head or tail of it. That’s for you- I \n",
      "haven’t brains enough. Now, hunting is another matter- \n",
      "that’s it, come on! Open the door, there!’ he shouted. \n",
      "‘Why have you shut it?’ \n",
      "The door at the end of the passage led to the \n",
      "huntsmen’s room, as they called the room for the hunt \n",
      "servants. \n",
      "There was a rapid patter of bare feet, and an unseen \n",
      "hand opened the door into th e huntsmen’s room, from \n",
      "which came the clear sounds of a balalayka on which \n",
      "someone, who was evidently a master of the art, was \n",
      "playing. Natasha had been liste ning to those strains for \n",
      "some time and now went out into the passage to hear \n",
      "better. \n",
      "‘That’s Mitka, my coachman.... I have got him a good \n",
      "balalayka. I’m fond of it,’ said ‘Uncle.’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1192 of 2882 \n",
      "It was the custom for Mitka to play the balalayka in the \n",
      "huntsmen’s room when ‘Uncle’ returned from the chase. \n",
      "‘Uncle’ was fond of such music. \n",
      "‘How good! Really very good! ’ said Nicholas with \n",
      "some unintentional supercili ousness, as if ashamed to \n",
      "confess that the sounds pleased him very much. \n",
      "‘Very good?’ said Natasha reproachfully, noticing her \n",
      "brother’s tone. ‘Not ‘very good’ it’s simply delicious!’ \n",
      "Just as ‘Uncle’s’ pickled mushrooms, honey, and \n",
      "cherry brandy had seemed to her the best in the world, so \n",
      "also that song, at that moment, seemed to her the acme of \n",
      "musical delight. \n",
      "‘More, please, more!’ cried Natasha at the door as soon \n",
      "as the balalayka ceased. Mitka tuned up afresh, and \n",
      "recommenced thrumming the balalayka to the air of My \n",
      "Lady, with trills and varia tions. ‘Uncle’ sat listening, \n",
      "slightly smiling, with his head on one side. The air was \n",
      "repeated a hundred times. The balalayka was retuned \n",
      "several times and the same notes were thrummed again, \n",
      "but the listeners did not grow  weary of it and wished to \n",
      "hear it again and again. Anisya Fedorovna came in and \n",
      "leaned her portly person against the doorpost. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1193 of 2882 \n",
      "‘You like listening?’ she said to Natasha, with a smile \n",
      "extremely like ‘Uncle’s.’ ‘That’s a good player of ours,’ \n",

      "‘He doesn’t play that pa rt right!’ said ‘Uncle’ \n",
      "suddenly, with an energetic gesture. ‘Here he ought to \n",

      "‘Do you play then?’ asked Natasha. \n",
      "‘Uncle’ did not answer, but smiled. \n",
      "‘Anisya, go and see if the strings of my guitar are all \n",
      "right. I haven’t touched it for a long time. That’s it- come \n",
      "on! I’ve given it up.’ \n",
      "Anisya Fedorovna, with her light step, willingly went \n",
      "to fulfill her errand and brought back the guitar. \n",
      "Without looking at anyone, ‘Uncle’ blew the dust off it \n",
      "and, tapping the case with his bony fingers, tuned the \n",
      "guitar and settled himself in his armchair. He took the \n",
      "guitar a little above the fingerboard, arching his left elbow \n",
      "with a somewhat theatrical ge sture, and, with a wink at \n",
      "Anisya Fedorovna, struck a single chord, pure and \n",
      "sonorous, and then quietly, smoothly, and confidently \n",
      "began playing in very slow time, not My Lady, but the \n",
      "well-known song: Came a maiden down the street. The \n",
      "tune, played with precision a nd in exact time, began to \n",
      "thrill in the hearts of Nicholas and Natasha, arousing in War and Peace  \n",
      "1194 of 2882 \n",
      "them the same kind of sober mirth as radiated from \n",
      "Anisya Fedorovna’s whole being. Anisya Fedorovna \n",
      "flushed, and drawing her ke rchief over her face went \n",
      "laughing out of the room. ‘U ncle’ continued to play \n",
      "correctly, carefully, with ener getic firmness, looking with \n",
      "a changed and inspired expression at the spot where \n",
      "Anisya Fedorovna had just stood. Something seemed to \n",
      "be laughing a little on one side of his face under his gray \n",
      "mustaches, especially as th e song grew brisker and the \n",
      "time quicker and when, here and there, as he ran his \n",
      "fingers over the strings, something seemed to snap. \n",
      "‘Lovely, lovely! Go on, Uncle, go on!’ shouted \n",
      "Natasha as soon as he had finished. She jumped up and \n",
      "hugged and kissed him. ‘Nicholas, Nicholas!’ she said, \n",
      "turning to her brother, as if asking him: ‘What is it moves \n",
      "me so?’ \n",
      "Nicholas too was greatly pleased by ‘Uncle’s’ playing, \n",
      "and ‘Uncle’ played the piece over again. Anisya \n",
      "Fedorovna’s smiling face reappeared in the doorway and \n",
      "behind hers other faces... \n",
      "Fetching water clear and sweet, \n",
      "Stop, dear maiden, I entreat- \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1195 of 2882 \n",
      "played ‘Uncle’ once more, running his fingers \n",
      "skillfully over the strings, and then he stopped short and \n",
      "jerked his shoulders. \n",
      "‘Go on, Uncle dear,’ Natasha wailed in an imploring \n",
      "tone as if her life depended on it. \n",
      "‘Uncle’ rose, and it was as if there were two men in \n",
      "him: one of them smiled seriously at the merry fellow, \n",
      "while the merry fellow struck a naive and precise attitude \n",
      "preparatory to a folk dance. \n",
      "‘Now then, niece!’ he excl aimed, waving to Natasha \n",
      "the hand that had just struck a chord. \n",
      "Natasha threw off the shawl from her shoulders, ran \n",

      "1197 of 2882 \n",
      "would understand it all. Wher e is he now?’ she thought, \n",

      "song: \n",
      "As ‘twas growing dark last night \n",
      "Fell the snow so soft and light... \n",
      "‘Uncle’ sang as peasants sing, with full and naive \n",
      "conviction that the whole meaning of a song lies in the \n",
      "words and that the tune comes of itself, and that apart \n",
      "from the words there is no tune, which exists only to give \n",
      "measure to the words. As a result of this the unconsidered \n",
      "tune, like the song of a bird, was extraordinarily good. \n",
      "Natasha was in ecstasies over ‘Uncle’s’ singing. She \n",
      "resolved to give up learning the harp and to play only the \n",

      "After nine o’clock two traps and three mounted men, \n",

      "that heaven knows where we are really going in the \n",

      "1202 of 2882 \n",
      "the count and countess could not conceive of existence \n",
      "remained unchanged. Ther e was still the hunting \n",

      "1211 of 2882 \n",
      "Petya ran up and offered her his back. She jumped on \n",
      "it, putting her arms round his neck, and he pranced along \n",
      "with her. \n",
      "‘No, don’t... the island of Ma dagascar!’ she said, and \n",
      "jumping off his back she went downstairs. \n",
      "Having as it were reviewed her kingdom, tested her \n",
      "power, and made sure that everyone was submissive, but \n",
      "that all the same it was dull, Natasha betook herself to the \n",
      "ballroom, picked up her guitar, sat down in a dark corner \n",
      "behind a bookcase, and began to run her fingers over the \n",
      "strings in the bass, picki ng out a passage she recalled \n",
      "from an opera she had heard in Petersburg with Prince \n",
      "Andrew. What she drew from  the guitar would have had \n",
      "no meaning for other listeners , but in her imagination a \n",
      "whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds. \n",
      "She sat behind the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a \n",
      "streak of light es caping from the pant ry door and listened \n",
      "to herself and pondered. She wa s in a mood for brooding \n",
      "on the past. \n",
      "Sonya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand. \n",
      "Natasha glanced at her and at the crack in the pantry door, \n",
      "and it seemed to her that she remembered the light failing \n",
      "through that crack once before and Sonya passing with a War and Peace  \n",
      "1212 of 2882 \n",
      "glass in her hand. ‘Yes it was exactly the same,’ thought \n",
      "Natasha. \n",
      "‘Sonya, what is this?’ she cried, twanging a thick \n",
      "string. \n",
      "‘Oh, you are there!’ said Sonya with a start, and came \n",
      "near and listened. ‘I don’t know. A storm?’ she ventured \n",
      "timidly, afraid of being wrong. \n",
      "‘There! That’s just how sh e started and just how she \n",
      "came up smiling timidly when all this happened before,’ \n",
      "thought Natasha, ‘and in just the same way I thought there \n",
      "was something lacking in her.’ \n",
      "‘No, it’s the chorus from Th e Water-Carrier, listen! ‘ \n",
      "and Natasha sang the air of the chorus so that Sonya \n",
      "should catch it. ‘Where were you going?’ she asked. \n",
      "‘To change the water in this glass. I am just finishing \n",
      "the design.’ \n",
      "‘You always find something to  do, but I can’t,’ said \n",
      "Natasha. ‘And where’s Nicholas?’ \n",
      "‘Asleep, I think.’ \n",
      "‘Sonya, go and wake him,’ said Natasha. ‘Tell him I \n",
      "want him to come and sing.’ \n",
      "She sat awhile, wondering what  the meaning of it all \n",
      "having happened before could be, and without solving \n",
      "this problem, or at all regretting not having done so, she \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1213 of 2882 \n",
      "again passed in fancy to the time when she was with him \n",
      "and he was looking at her with a lover’s eyes. \n",
      "‘Oh, if only he would come qui cker! I am so afraid it \n",
      "will never be! And, worst of all,  I am growing old- that’s \n",
      "the thing! There won’t then be  in me what there is now. \n",
      "But perhaps he’ll come today, will come immediately. \n",
      "Perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing room. \n",
      "Perhaps he came yesterday and I have forgotten it.’ She \n",
      "rose, put down the guitar, and went to the drawing room. \n",
      "All the domestic circle, tutors, governesses, and guests, \n",
      "were already at the tea table. The servants stood round the \n",
      "table- but Prince Andrew was not there and life was going \n",
      "on as before. \n",
      "‘Ah, here she is!’ said the old count, when he saw \n",
      "Natasha enter. ‘Well, sit down by me.’ But Natasha \n",
      "stayed by her mother and gl anced round as if looking for \n",
      "something. \n",
      "‘Mamma!’ she muttered, ‘give him to me, give him, \n",
      "Mamma, quickly, quickly!’ and she again had difficulty in \n",
      "repressing her sobs. \n",
      "She sat down at the table and listened to the \n",
      "conversation between the elde rs and Nicholas, who had \n",
      "also come to the table. ‘My God, my God! The same \n",
      "faces, the same talk, Papa holding his cup and blowing in War and Peace  \n",
      "1214 of 2882 \n",
      "the same way!’ thought Natasha, feeling with horror a \n",
      "sense of repulsion rising up in her for the whole \n",
      "household, because they were always the same. \n",
      "After tea, Nicholas, Sonya, and Natasha went to the \n",
      "sitting room, to their favorite corner where their most \n",
      "intimate talks always began. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1215 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter X \n",
      "Does it ever happen to you,’ said Natasha to her \n",
      "brother, when they settled down in the sitting room, ‘does \n",
      "it ever happen to you to feel as if there were nothing more \n",
      "to come- nothing; that ever ything good is past? And to \n",
      "feel not exactly dull, but sad?’ \n",
      "‘I should think so!’ he replie d. ‘I have felt like that \n",
      "when everything was all right and everyone was cheerful. \n",
      "The thought has come into my mind that I was already \n",
      "tired of it all, and that we must all die. Once in the \n",
      "regiment I had not gone to some merrymaking where \n",
      "there was music... and suddenly I felt so depressed..’ \n",
      "‘Oh yes, I know, I know, I know!’ Natasha interrupted \n",
      "him. ‘When I was quite little th at used to be so with me. \n",
      "Do you remember when I was punished once about some \n",
      "plums? You were all danci ng, and I sat sobbing in the \n",
      "schoolroom? I shall never forget it: I felt sad and sorry for \n",
      "everyone, for myself, and for everyone. And I was \n",
      "innocent- that was the chief th ing,’ said Natasha. ‘Do you \n",
      "remember?’ \n",
      "‘I remember,’ answered Nicholas. ‘I remember that I \n",
      "came to you afterwards and wanted to comfort you, but \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1216 of 2882 \n",
      "do you know, I felt ashamed to. We were terribly absurd. \n",
      "I had a funny doll then and wanted to give it to you. Do \n",
      "you remember?’ \n",
      "‘And do you remember,’ Natasha asked with a pensive \n",
      "smile, ‘how once, long, long ago, when we were quite \n",
      "little, Uncle called us into the study- that was in the old \n",
      "house- and it was dark- we we nt in and suddenly there \n",
      "stood..’ \n",
      "‘A Negro,’ chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight. \n",
      "‘Of course I remember. Even now I don’t know whether \n",
      "there really was a Negro, or if we only dreamed it or were \n",
      "told about him.’ \n",
      "‘He was gray, you remember, and had white teeth, and \n",
      "stood and looked at us..’ \n",
      "‘Sonya, do you remember?’ asked Nicholas. \n",
      "‘Yes, yes, I do remember something too,’ Sonya \n",
      "answered timidly. \n",
      "‘You know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that \n",
      "Negro,’ said Natasha, ‘and they say there was no Negro at \n",
      "all. But you see, you remember!’ \n",
      "‘Of course I do, I remember his teeth as if I had just \n",
      "seen them.’ \n",
      "‘How strange it is! It’s as  if it were a dream! I like \n",
      "that.’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1217 of 2882 \n",
      "‘And do you remember how we rolled hard-boiled \n",
      "eggs in the ballroom, and suddenly two old women began \n",
      "spinning round on the carpet? Was that real or not? Do \n",
      "you remember what fun it was?’ \n",
      "‘Yes, and you remember how Papa in his blue overcoat \n",
      "fired a gun in the porch?’ \n",
      "So they went through th eir memories, smiling with \n",
      "pleasure: not the sad memories of old age, but poetic, \n",
      "youthful ones- those impressions  of one’s most distant \n",
      "past in which dreams and re alities blend- and they \n",
      "laughed with quiet enjoyment. \n",
      "Sonya, as always, did not quite keep pace with them, \n",
      "though they shared the same reminiscences. \n",
      "Much that they remembered had slipped from her \n",
      "mind, and what she recalled did not arouse the same \n",
      "poetic feeling as they experienced. She simply enjoyed \n",
      "their pleasure and tried to fit in with it. \n",
      "She only really took part wh en they recalled Sonya’s \n",
      "first arrival. She told them how afraid she had been of \n",
      "Nicholas because he had on a corded jacket and her nurse \n",
      "had told her that she, too, would be sewn up with cords. \n",
      "‘And I remember their telling me that you had been \n",
      "born under a cabbage,’ said Natasha, and I remember that War and Peace  \n",
      "1218 of 2882 \n",
      "I dared not disbelieve it the n, but knew that it was not \n",
      "true, and I felt so uncomfortable.’ \n",
      "While they were talking a maid thrust her head in at \n",
      "the other door of the sitting room. \n",
      "‘They have brought the cock, Miss,’ she said in a \n",

      "In the middle of their talk in the sitting room, Dimmler \n",
      "came in and went up to the harp that stood there in a \n",
      "corner. He took off its cloth covering, and the harp gave \n",
      "out a jarring sound. \n",
      "‘Mr. Dimmler, please play my favorite nocturne by \n",
      "Field,’ came the old counte ss’ voice from the drawing \n",

      "Dimmler struck a chord and, turning to Natasha, \n",
      "Nicholas, and Sonya, rema rked: ‘How quiet you young \n",
      "people are!’ \n",
      "‘Yes, we’re philosophizing,’ said Natasha, glancing \n",
      "round for a moment and then continuing the conversation. \n",
      "They were now discussing dreams. \n",
      "Dimmler began to play; Natasha went on tiptoe \n",
      "noiselessly to the table, took up a candle, carried it out, \n",
      "and returned, seating herself quietly in her former place. It \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1219 of 2882 \n",
      "was dark in the room especially where they were sitting \n",
      "on the sofa, but through the bi g windows the silvery light \n",
      "of the full moon fell on the floor. Dimmler had finished \n",
      "the piece but still sat softly running his fingers over the \n",
      "strings, evidently uncertain whether to stop or to play \n",
      "something else. \n",
      "‘Do you know,’ said Natasha in a whisper, moving \n",
      "closer to Nicholas and Sonya, ‘that when one goes on and \n",
      "on recalling memories, one at last begins to remember \n",
      "what happened before one was in the world..’ \n",
      "‘That is metempsychosis,’ said Sonya, who had always \n",
      "learned well, and remembered everything. ‘The Egyptians \n",
      "believed that our souls have lived in animals, and will go \n",
      "back into animals again.’ \n",
      "‘No, I don’t believe we ever were in animals,’ said \n",
      "Natasha, still in a whisper though the music had ceased. \n",
      "‘But I am certain that we were angels somewhere there, \n",
      "and have been here, and that is why we remember...’ \n",
      "‘May I join you?’ said Di mmler who had come up \n",
      "quietly, and he sat down by them. \n",
      "‘If we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?’ \n",
      "said Nicholas. ‘No, that can’t be!’ \n",
      "‘Not lower, who said we were lower?... How do I \n",
      "know what I was before?’ Natasha rejoined with War and Peace  \n",
      "1220 of 2882 \n",
      "conviction. ‘The soul is immo rtal- well then, if I shall \n",
      "always live I must have lived before, lived for a whole \n",
      "eternity.’ \n",
      "‘Yes, but it is hard for us to imagine eternity,’ \n",
      "remarked Dimmler, who had jo ined the young folk with a \n",
      "mildly condescending smile but now spoke as quietly and \n",
      "seriously as they. \n",
      "‘Why is it hard to imagine eternity?’ said Natasha. ‘It \n",
      "is now today, and it will be tomorrow, and always; and \n",
      "there was yesterday, and the day before..’ \n",
      "‘Natasha! Now it’s your tu rn. Sing me something,’ \n",
      "they heard the countess sa y. ‘Why are you sitting there \n",
      "like conspirators?’ \n",
      "‘Mamma, I don’t at all want to,’ replied Natasha, but \n",
      "all the same she rose. \n",
      "None of them, not even the middle-aged Dimmler, \n",
      "wanted to break off their conversation and quit that corner \n",
      "in the sitting room, but Nata sha got up and Nicholas sat \n",
      "down at the clavichord. Standing as usual in the middle of \n",
      "the hall and choosing the place where the resonance was \n",
      "best, Natasha began to sing her mother’s favorite song. \n",
      "She had said she did not want to sing, but it was long \n",
      "since she had sung, and long before she again sang, as she \n",
      "did that evening. The count, from his study where he was \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1221 of 2882 \n",
      "talking to Mitenka, heard he r and, like a schoolboy in a \n",
      "hurry to run out to play, blundered in his talk while giving \n",
      "orders to the steward, and at  last stopped, while Mitenka \n",
      "stood in front of him also listening and smiling. Nicholas \n",
      "did not take his eyes off his si ster and drew breath in time \n",
      "with her. Sonya, as she liste ned, thought of the immense \n",
      "difference there was between herself and her friend, and \n",
      "how impossible it was for he r to be anything like as \n",
      "bewitching as her cousin. The old countess sat with a \n",
      "blissful yet sad smile and with tears in her eyes, \n",
      "occasionally shaking her head. She thought of Natasha \n",
      "and of her own youth, and of  how there was something \n",
      "unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of \n",
      "Natasha and Prince Andrew. \n",
      "Dimmler, who had seated himself beside the countess, \n",
      "listened with closed eyes. \n",
      "‘Ah, Countess,’ he said at last, ‘that’s a European \n",
      "talent, she has nothing to learn-  what softness, tenderness, \n",
      "and strength...’ \n",
      "‘Ah, how afraid I am for he r, how afraid I am!’ said \n",
      "the countess, not realizing to whom she was speaking. \n",
      "Her maternal instinct told her that Natasha had too much \n",
      "of something, and that because of this she would not be \n",
      "happy. Before Natasha had fi nished singing, fourteen-War and Peace  \n",
      "1222 of 2882 \n",
      "year-old Petya rushed in delightedly, to say that some \n",
      "mummers had arrived. \n",
      "Natasha stopped abruptly. \n",
      "‘Idiot!’ she screamed at her brother and, running to a \n",
      "chair, threw herself on it, s obbing so violently that she \n",
      "could not stop for a long time. \n",
      "‘It’s nothing, Mamma, really it’s nothing; only Petya \n",
      "startled me,’ she said, trying to smile, but her tears still \n",
      "flowed and sobs still choked her. \n",
      "The mummers (some of the house serfs) dressed up as \n",
      "bears, Turks, innkeepers, and ladies- frightening and \n",
      "funny- bringing in with them the cold from outside and a \n",
      "feeling of gaiety, crowded, at first timidly, into the \n",
      "anteroom, then hiding behind one another they pushed \n",
      "into the ballroom where, shyly at first and then more and \n",
      "more merrily and heartily, th ey started singing, dancing, \n",
      "and playing Christmas games. The countess, when she \n",
      "had identified them and laughe d at their costumes, went \n",
      "into the drawing room. The count sat in the ballroom, \n",
      "smiling radiantly and appla uding the players. The young \n",
      "people had disappeared. \n",
      "Half an hour later ther e appeared among the other \n",

      "After the condescending su rprise, nonrecognition, and \n",

      "good that they ought to be shown elsewhere. \n",

      "drive to ‘Uncle’s.’ \n",
      "‘No, why disturb the old fe llow?’ said the countess. \n",

      "stronger and reached its climax when they all came out \n",

      "hoofs, the marks of which were  visible in the moonlight- \n",
      "the horses began to tug at th e reins of their own accord \n",

      "head and breaking into a short canter, tugged at his traces. \n",
      "The shaft horse swayed from side to side, moving his ears \n",
      "as if asking: ‘Isn’t it time to begin now?’ In front, already \n",

      "‘Gee up, my darlings!’ shouted Nicholas, pulling the \n",

      "It was only by the keener wind that met them and the \n",
      "jerks given by the side horse s who pulled harder- ever \n",
      "increasing their gallop- that one noticed how fast the \n",
      "troyka was flying. Nicholas looked back. With screams \n",
      "squeals, and waving of whips that caused even the shaft \n",
      "horses to gallop- the other sleighs followed. The shaft \n",
      "horse swung steadily beneath the bow ove r its head, with \n",
      "no thought of slackening pace and ready to put on speed \n",

      "across a meadow, near a river. \n",
      "‘Where are we?’ thought he. ‘It’s the Kosoy meadow, I \n",

      "‘Now, look out, master!’ he cried. \n",
      "Faster still the two troykas flew side by side, and faster \n",
      "moved the feet of the gallo ping side horses. Nicholas \n",
      "began to draw ahead. Zakhar, while still keeping his arms \n",
      "extended, raised one hand with the reins. \n",
      "‘No you won’t, master!’ he shouted. \n",
      "Nicholas put all his hors es to a gallop and passed \n",

      "not told her, yes, told her to  make a list, and not to admit \n",
      "anyone who was not on that list? Then why was that \n",

      "Mademoiselle Bourienne was the first to recover \n",

      "meanwhile tormenting Princess Mary. She knew what she \n",
      "ought to have said to Natasha, but she had been unable to \n",
      "say it because Mademoiselle Bourienne was in the way, \n",
      "and because, without knowing why, she felt it very \n",
      "difficult to speak of the marriage. When the count was \n",

      "a deep sigh: \n",
      "‘Wait, I must..’ \n",

      "Natasha noticed this and guessed its reason. \n",
      "‘I think, Princess, it is not c onvenient to speak of that \n",
      "now,’ she said with external dignity and coldness, though \n",

      "‘What have I said and what have I done?’ thought she, \n",
      "as soon as she was out of the room. \n",
      "They waited a long time for Natasha to come to dinner \n",
      "that day. She sat in her room  crying like a child, blowing \n",

      "1305 of 2882 \n",

      "Dmitrievna, who knew how the prince had received the \n",

      "Marya Dmitrievna had taken a box. \n",
      "Natasha did not want to go, but could not refuse Marya \n",
      "Dmitrievna’s kind offer which was intended expressly for \n",
      "her. When she came ready dressed into the ballroom to \n",
      "await her father, and looking in the large mirror there saw \n",
      "that she was pretty, very pret ty, she felt even more sad, \n",
      "but it was a sweet, tender sadness. \n",
      "‘O God, if he were here now  I would not behave as I \n",

      "make him look at me with those searching inquiring eyes \n",
      "with which he has so often looked at me, and then I would \n",
      "make him laugh as he used to laugh. And his eyes- how I \n",

      "that face and those eyes, with his smile, manly and yet \n",
      "childlike.... No, I had better not think of him; not think of \n",

      "Natasha at that moment felt so softened and tender that \n",

      "flickering on the frozen wi ndow, she felt still sadder and \n",
      "more in love, and forgot wh ere she was going and with \n",
      "whom. Having fallen into th e line of carriages, the \n",
      "Rostovs’ carriage drove up to the theater, its wheels \n",
      "squeaking over the snow. Natasha and Sonya, holding up \n",

      "‘Natasha, your hair!...’ whispered Sonya. \n",

      "feminine envy at Natasha. Th e curtain had not yet risen \n",
      "and the overture was being played. Natasha, smoothing \n",
      "her gown, went in with Sonya and sat down, scanning the \n",
      "brilliant tiers of boxes opposite . A sensation she had not \n",
      "experienced for a long time- that of hundreds of eyes \n",
      "looking at her bare arms and neck- suddenly affected her \n",

      "The two remarkably pretty girls, Natasha and Sonya, \n",
      "with Count Rostov who had not been seen in Moscow for \n",

      "Natasha’s looks, as everyone told her, had improved in \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1309 of 2882 \n",
      "indifference to everything a bout her. Her black eyes \n",
      "looked at the crowd without  seeking anyone, and her \n",
      "delicate arm, bare to above the elbow, lay on the velvet \n",
      "edge of the box, while, evidently unconsciously, she \n",
      "opened and closed her hand  in time to the music, \n",
      "crumpling her program. ‘Look, there’s Alenina,’ said \n",

      "with a happy look on her face and a string of pearls round \n",
      "her thick red neck- which Natasha knew was covered with \n",
      "powder. Behind them, wearing a smile and leaning over \n",
      "with an ear to Julie’s mouth, was Boris’ handsome \n",
      "smoothly brushed head. He looked the Rostovs from War and Peace  \n",
      "1310 of 2882 \n",
      "under his brows and said something, smiling, to his \n",

      "Behind them sat Anna Mikhaylovna wearing a green \n",
      "headdress and with a happy look of resignation to the will \n",
      "of God on her face. Their box was pervaded by that \n",
      "atmosphere of an affianced couple which Natasha knew \n",
      "so well and liked so much. She turned away and suddenly \n",
      "remembered all that had been so humiliating in her \n",
      "morning’s visit. \n",
      "‘What right has he not to wish to receive me into his \n",

      "very center, leaning back against the orchestra rail, stood \n",
      "Dolokhov in a Persian dress, his curly hair brushed up \n",
      "into a huge shock. He stood in full view of the audience, \n",
      "well aware that he was attracting everyone’s attention, yet \n",

      "adjoining box rustling her h eavy silk dress and took a \n",
      "long time settling into her place. \n",
      "Natasha involuntarily gazed at that neck, those \n",
      "shoulders, and pearls and coiffure, and admired the beauty \n",
      "of the shoulders and the pear ls. While Natasha was fixing \n",
      "her gaze on her for the sec ond time the lady looked round \n",

      "The floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards, at \n",
      "the sides was some painted cardboard representing trees, \n",
      "and at the back was a cloth stretched over boards. In the \n",
      "center of the stage sat some girls in red bodices and white \n",
      "skirts. One very fat girl in a white silk dress sat apart on a \n",
      "low bench, to the back of  which a piece of green \n",
      "cardboard was glued. They all sang something. When \n",

      "First the man in the tight trousers sang alone, then she \n",
      "sang, then they both paused while the orch estra played \n",

      "their arms, and bowing. \n",
      "After her life in the country, and in her present serious \n",

      "1314 of 2882 \n",
      "She could not follow the opera nor even listen to the \n",
      "music; she saw only the painted cardboard and the \n",
      "queerly dressed men and women who moved, spoke, and \n",
      "sang so strangely in that brilliant light. She knew what it \n",
      "was all meant to represent, but it was so pretentiously \n",
      "false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed for the \n",
      "actors and then amused at them. She looked at the faces of \n",
      "the audience, seeking in them the same sense of ridicule \n",
      "and perplexity she herself experienced, but they all \n",
      "seemed attentive to what was happening on the stage, and \n",
      "expressed delight which to Natasha seemed feigned. ‘I \n",
      "suppose it has to be like this!’ she thought. She kept \n",
      "looking round in turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the \n",
      "stalls and then at the seminude women in the boxes, \n",
      "especially at Helene in th e next box, who- apparently \n",
      "quite unclothed- sat with a qui et tranquil smile, not taking \n",
      "her eyes off the stage. And f eeling the bright light that \n",
      "flooded the whole place and the warm air heated by the \n",
      "crowd, Natasha little by little began to pass into a state of \n",
      "intoxication she had not experienced for a long while. She \n",
      "did not realize who and wher e she was, nor what was \n",
      "going on before her. As she looked and thought, the \n",
      "strangest fancies unexpectedly  and disconnectedly passed \n",
      "through her mind: the idea occurred to her of jumping \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1315 of 2882 \n",
      "onto the edge of the box and singing the air the actress \n",
      "was singing, then she wished to touch with her fan an old \n",

      "Helene and tickle her. \n",
      "At a moment when all was quiet before the \n",

      "the side nearest the Rostovs’ box creaked, and the steps of \n",
      "a belated arrival were he ard. ‘There’s Kuragin!’ \n",
      "whispered Shinshin. Countess Bezukhova turned smiling \n",

      "that look, saw an exceptionally handsome adjutant \n",
      "approaching their box with a self-assured yet courteous \n",

      "and noticed long ago at the ball in Petersburg. He was \n",
      "now in an adjutant’s uniform with one epaulet and a \n",
      "shoulder knot. He moved with a restrained swagger which \n",

      "expression of good-humored complacency and gaiety. \n",
      "Though the performance was proceeding, he walked \n",
      "deliberately down the carpete d gangway, his sword and \n",
      "spurs slightly jingling and hi s handsome perfumed head \n",
      "held high. Having looked at Natasha he approached his \n",
      "sister, laid his well gloved hand on the edge of her box, War and Peace  \n",
      "1316 of 2882 \n",
      "nodded to her, and leaning forward asked a question, with \n",
      "a motion toward Natasha. \n",
      "‘Mais charmante!’ said he, evidently referring to \n",
      "Natasha, who did not exactly hear his words but \n",
      "understood them from the movement of his lips. Then he \n",
      "took his place in the first ro w of the stalls and sat down \n",
      "beside Dolokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly \n",
      "and offhand way that Dolokhov whom others treated so \n",
      "fawningly. He winked at him gaily, smiled, and rested his \n",
      "foot against the orchestra screen. \n",
      "‘How like the brother is to the sister,’ remarked the \n",
      "count. ‘And how handsome they both are!’ \n",
      "Shinshin, lowering his voice, began to tell the count of \n",

      "to overhear it just because he had said she was \n",
      "‘charmante.’ \n",
      "The first act was over. In the stalls everyone began \n",

      "Boris came to the Rostovs’ box, received their \n",

      "with an absent-minded smile conveyed to Natasha and \n",

      "away. Natasha with a gay, coque ttish smile talked to him, \n",

      "1317 of 2882 \n",
      "Boris with whom she had form erly been in love. In the \n",

      "and natural. \n",
      "The scantily clad Helene smiled at everyone in the \n",
      "same way, and Natasha gave Boris a similar smile. \n",
      "Helene’s box was filled and surrounded from the stalls \n",
      "by the most distinguished and intellectual men, who \n",

      "During the whole of that en tr’acte Kuragin stood with \n",
      "Dolokhov in front of the orchestra partition, looking at the \n",

      "this afforded her pleasure. She even turned so that he \n",
      "should see her profile in wh at she thought was its most \n",
      "becoming aspect. Before the beginning of the second act \n",
      "Pierre appeared in the stal ls. The Rostovs had not seen \n",
      "him since their arrival. His face looked sad, and he had \n",
      "grown still stouter since Natasha last saw him. He passed \n",
      "up to the front rows, not not icing anyone. Anatole went \n",
      "up to him and began speaking to him, looking at and \n",
      "indicating the Rostovs’ box. On seeing Natasha Pierre \n",
      "grew animated and, hastily passing between the rows, \n",
      "came toward their box. When he got there he leaned on \n",
      "his elbows and, smiling, talked to her for a long time. War and Peace  \n",
      "1318 of 2882 \n",
      "While conversing with Pierre, Natasha heard a man’s \n",
      "voice in Countess Bezukhova’s box and something told \n",
      "her it was Kuragin. She turned and their eyes met. Almost \n",
      "smiling, he gazed straight into  her eyes with such an \n",
      "enraptured caressing look that  it seemed strange to be so \n",
      "near him, to look at him like that, to be so sure he admired \n",
      "her, and not to be acquainted with him. \n",
      "In the second act there was scenery representing \n",
      "tombstones, there was a round hole in the canvas to \n",

      "notes while many people appeared from right and left \n",
      "wearing black cloaks and holding things like daggers in \n",

      "who had been in white and wa s now in light blue. They \n",
      "did not drag her away at once, but sang with her for a long \n",
      "time and then at last dra gged her off, and behind the \n",

      "Danilov’s or other Moscow revelers’, drank whole nights \n",
      "through, outvying everyone else , and was at all the balls \n",
      "and parties of the best society. There was talk of his \n",

      "On Sunday morning Marya Dmitrievna invited her \n",
      "visitors to Mass at her parish church- the Church of the \n",
      "Assumption built over the graves of victims of the plague. \n",
      "‘I don’t like those fashiona ble churches,’ she said, \n",

      "‘God is the same every where. We have an excellent \n",

      "indulgence!’ \n",
      "Marya Dmitrievna liked Sundays and knew how to \n",
      "keep them. Her whole house was scrubbed and cleaned on \n",
      "Saturdays; neither she nor the servants worked, and they \n",
      "all wore holiday dress and we nt to church. At her table \n",
      "there were extra dishes at dinner, and the servants had \n",
      "vodka and roast goose or suck ling pig. But in nothing in \n",
      "the house was the holiday so  noticeable as in Marya \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1335 of 2882 \n",
      "Dmitrievna’s broad, stern face, which on that day wore an \n",
      "invariable look of solemn festivity. \n",
      "After Mass, when they had finished their coffee in the \n",
      "dining room where the loose covers had been removed \n",
      "from the furniture, a servant announced that the carriage \n",
      "was ready, and Marya Dmitrievna  rose with a stern air. \n",
      "She wore her holiday shawl, in which she paid calls, and \n",
      "announced that she was going to see Prince Nicholas \n",
      "Bolkonski to have an e xplanation with him about \n",

      "After she had gone, a dressmaker from Madame \n",
      "Suppert-Roguet waited on the Rostovs, and Natasha, very \n",
      "glad of this divers ion, having shut he rself into a room \n",
      "adjoining the drawing room, occupied herself trying on \n",
      "the new dresses. Just as she had put on a bodice without \n",
      "sleeves and only tacked toge ther, and was turning her \n",
      "head to see in the glass how the back fitted, she heard in \n",
      "the drawing room the animated sounds of her father’s \n",
      "voice and another’s- a woman’s-  that made her flush. It \n",
      "was Helene. Natasha had not time to take off the bodice \n",
      "before the door opened and Countess Bezukhova, dressed \n",
      "in a purple velvet gown with a high collar, came into the \n",
      "room beaming with good-humored amiable smiles. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1336 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Oh, my enchantress!’ she cried to the blushing \n",
      "Natasha. ‘Charming! No, this is really beyond anything, \n",
      "my dear count,’ said she to Count Rostov who had \n",
      "followed her in. ‘How can you live in Moscow and go \n",
      "nowhere? No, I won’t let you o ff! Mademoiselle George \n",
      "will recite at my house toni ght and there’ll be some \n",
      "people, and if you don’t bring your lovely girls- who are \n",
      "prettier than Mademoiselle  George- I won’t know you! \n",
      "My husband is away in Tver or I would send him to fetch \n",
      "you. You must come. You positively must! Between eight \n",
      "and nine.’ \n",
      "She nodded to the dressmak er, whom she knew and \n",
      "who had curtsied respectfully to  her, and seated herself in \n",
      "an armchair beside the looking glass, draping the folds of \n",
      "her velvet dress pictures quely. She did not cease \n",
      "chattering good-naturedly and gaily, continually praising \n",
      "Natasha’s beauty. She looked at Natasha’s dresses and \n",
      "praised them, as well as a new dress of her own made of \n",
      "‘metallic gauze,’ which she had received from Paris, and \n",
      "advised Natasha to have one like it. \n",
      "‘But anything suits you, my charmer!’ she remarked. \n",
      "A smile of pleasure never left Natasha’s face. She felt \n",
      "happy and as if she were blossoming under the praise of \n",
      "this dear Countess Bezukhova who had formerly seemed \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1337 of 2882 \n",
      "to her so unapproachable a nd important and was now so \n",
      "kind to her. Natasha brightened up and felt almost in love \n",
      "with this woman, who was so beautiful and so kind. \n",
      "Helene for her part was sincerely delighted with Natasha \n",
      "and wished to give her a good time. Anatole had asked \n",
      "her to bring him and Natasha together, and she was \n",
      "calling on the Rostovs for that purpose. The idea of \n",
      "throwing her brother and Natasha together amused her. \n",
      "Though at one time, in Petersburg, she had been \n",
      "annoyed with Natasha for dr awing Boris away, she did \n",
      "not think of that now, and in her own way heartily wished \n",
      "Natasha well. As she was leaving the Rostovs she called \n",
      "her protegee aside. \n",
      "‘My brother dined with me ye sterday- we nearly died \n",
      "of laughter- he ate nothing a nd kept sighing for you, my \n",

      "Natasha blushed scarlet when she heard this. \n",
      "‘How she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!’ said \n",
      "Helene. ‘You must certainly come. If you love somebody, \n",
      "my charmer, that is not a r eason to shut yourself up. Even \n",

      "‘So she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband \n",

      "this. So it’s all right.’ And again, under Helene’s \n",
      "influence, what had seemed terrible now seemed simple \n",
      "and natural. ‘And she is such a grande dame, so kind, and \n",
      "evidently likes me so much. And why not enjoy myself?’ \n",
      "thought Natasha, gazing at Helene with wide-open, \n",
      "wondering eyes. \n",
      "Marya Dmitrievna came back to dinner taciturn and \n",
      "serious, having evidently suffered a defeat at the old \n",
      "prince’s. She was still too agitated by the enco unter to be \n",
      "able to talk of th e affair calmly. In an swer to the count’s \n",
      "inquiries she replied that things were all right and that she \n",

      "Bezukhova’s visit and the invi tation for that evening, \n",

      "Count Rostov took the girl s to Countess Bezukhova’s. \n",
      "There were a good many people there, but nearly all \n",
      "strangers to Natasha. Count Rostov was displeased to see \n",
      "that the company consisted almost entirely of men and \n",
      "women known for the freedom of their conduct. \n",
      "Mademoiselle George was standing in a corner of the \n",
      "drawing room surrounded by young men. There were \n",
      "several Frenchmen present, among them Metivier who \n",
      "from the time Helene reached Moscow had been an \n",
      "intimate in her house. The c ount decided not to sit down \n",
      "to cards or let his girls out of his sight and to get away as \n",
      "soon as Mademoiselle George’s performance was over. \n",
      "Anatole was at the door, evidently on the lookout for \n",
      "the Rostovs. Immediately after greeting the count he went \n",
      "up to Natasha and followed her. As soon as she saw him \n",
      "she was seized by the same feeling she had had at the \n",
      "opera- gratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at \n",
      "the absence of a moral barrier between them. \n",
      "Helene welcomed Natasha delightedly and was loud in \n",
      "admiration of her beauty and her dress. Soon after their \n",
      "arrival Mademoiselle George went out of the room to War and Peace  \n",
      "1340 of 2882 \n",
      "change her costume. In the drawing room people began \n",
      "arranging the chairs and taking their seats. Anatole moved \n",
      "a chair for Natasha and was about to sit down beside her, \n",
      "but the count, who never lost sight of her, took the seat \n",
      "himself. Anatole sat down behind her. \n",
      "Mademoiselle George, with her bare, fat, dimpled \n",
      "arms, and a red shawl draped over one shoulder, came \n",
      "into the space left vacant for her, and assumed an \n",
      "unnatural pose. Enthusiastic whispering was audible. \n",
      "Mademoiselle George looked sternly and gloomily at \n",
      "the audience and began reciting some French verses \n",
      "describing her guilty love for her son. In some places she \n",
      "raised her voice, in others she whispered, lifting her head \n",
      "triumphantly; sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse \n",
      "sounds, rolling her eyes. \n",
      "‘Adorable! divine! delicious !’ was heard from every \n",
      "side. \n",
      "Natasha looked at the fat actress, but neither saw nor \n",
      "heard nor understood anythi ng of what went on before \n",
      "her. She only felt herself again completely borne away \n",
      "into this strange senseless wo rld- so remote from her old \n",
      "world- a world in which it was impossible to know what \n",
      "was good or bad, reasonable or senseless. Behind her sat \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1341 of 2882 \n",
      "Anatole, and conscious of his proximity she experienced a \n",
      "frightened sense of expectancy. \n",
      "After the first monologue the whole company rose and \n",
      "surrounded Mademoiselle Ge orge, expressing their \n",
      "enthusiasm. \n",
      "‘How beautiful she is!’ Natasha remarked to her father \n",
      "who had also risen and was moving through the crowd \n",
      "toward the actress. \n",
      "‘I don’t think so when I look  at you!’ said Anatole, \n",
      "following Natasha. He said this at a moment when she \n",
      "alone could hear him. ‘You are enchanting... from the \n",
      "moment I saw you I have never ceased..’ \n",
      "‘Come, come, Natasha!’ said the count, as he turned \n",
      "back for his daughter. ‘How beautiful she is!’ Natasha \n",
      "without saying anything ste pped up to her father and \n",
      "looked at him with surprised inquiring eyes. \n",
      "After giving several recitations, Mademoiselle George \n",
      "left, and Countess Bezukhova asked her visitors into the \n",
      "ballroom. \n",
      "The count wished to go home, but Helene entreated \n",
      "him not to spoil her improvised ball, and the Rostovs \n",
      "stayed on. Anatole asked Natasha for a valse and as they \n",
      "danced he pressed her wais t and hand and told her she \n",
      "was bewitching and that he loved her. During the War and Peace  \n",
      "1342 of 2882 \n",
      "ecossaise, which she also danced with him, Anatole said \n",
      "nothing when they happened to be by themselves, but \n",
      "merely gazed at her. Natasha lifted her frightened eyes to \n",
      "him, but there was such c onfident tenderness in his \n",
      "affectionate look and smile that she could not, whilst \n",
      "looking at him, say what she had to say. She lowered her \n",
      "eyes. \n",
      "‘Don’t say such things to me. I am betrothed and love \n",
      "another,’ she said rapidly.... She glanced at him. \n",
      "Anatole was not upset or pained by what she had said. \n",
      "‘Don’t speak to me of that! What can I do?’ said he. ‘I \n",
      "tell you I am madly, madly, in love with you! Is it my \n",
      "fault that you are enchanting?... It’s our turn to begin.’ \n",
      "Natasha, animated and exc ited, looked about her with \n",
      "wide-open frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual. \n",
      "She understood hardly anything that went on that evening. \n",
      "They danced the ecossaise and the Grossvater. Her father \n",
      "asked her to come home, but she begged to remain. \n",
      "Wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to, \n",
      "she felt his eyes upon her. Later on she recalled how she \n",
      "had asked her father to let her go to the dressing room to \n",
      "rearrange her dress, that Helene had followed her and \n",
      "spoken laughingly of her brot her’s love, and that she \n",
      "again met Anatole in the little sitting room. Helene had \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1343 of 2882 \n",
      "disappeared leaving them al one, and Anatole had taken \n",
      "her hand and said in a tender voice: \n",
      "‘I cannot come to visit you but is it possible that I shall \n",
      "never see you? I love you madly. Can I never...?’ and, \n",
      "blocking her path, he brought his face close to hers. \n",
      "His large, glittering, masculin e eyes were so close to \n",
      "hers that she saw nothing but them. \n",
      "‘Natalie?’ he whispered inquiringly while she felt her \n",
      "hands being painfully pressed. ‘Natalie?’ \n",
      "‘I don’t understand. I have nothing to say,’ her eyes \n",
      "replied. \n",
      "Burning lips were pressed to hers, and at the same \n",
      "instant she felt herself releas ed, and Helene’s footsteps \n",
      "and the rustle of her dre ss were heard in the room. \n",
      "Natasha looked round at her, and then, red and trembling, \n",
      "threw a frightened look of i nquiry at Anatole and moved \n",
      "toward the door. \n",
      "‘One word, just one, for God’s sake!’ cried Anatole. \n",
      "She paused. She so wanted a word from him that \n",
      "would explain to her what had happened and to which she \n",
      "could find no answer. \n",
      "‘Natalie, just a word, only one!’ he kept repeating, \n",
      "evidently not knowing what to sa y and he repeated it till \n",
      "Helene came up to them. War and Peace  \n",
      "1344 of 2882 \n",
      "Helene returned with Nata sha to the drawing room. \n",
      "The Rostovs went away without staying for supper. \n",
      "After reaching home Natasha did not sleep all night. \n",
      "She was tormented by the inso luble question whether she \n",
      "loved Anatole or Prince Andrew. She loved Prince \n",
      "Andrew- she remembered distinctly how deeply she loved \n",
      "him. But she also loved Anat ole, of that there was no \n",
      "doubt. ‘Else how could all th is have happened?’ thought \n",
      "she. ‘If, after that, I could return his smile when saying \n",
      "good-by, if I was able to let it come to that, it means that I \n",
      "loved him from the first. It means that he is kind, noble, \n",
      "and splendid, and I could not help loving him. What am I \n",
      "to do if I love him and the other one too?’ she asked \n",
      "herself, unable to find an answer to these terrible \n",

      "Morning came with its cares  and bustle. Everyone got \n",
      "up and began to move about and talk, dressmakers came \n",
      "again. Marya Dmitrievna appeared, and they were called \n",
      "to breakfast. Natasha kept looking uneasily at everybody \n",
      "with wide-open eyes, as if wishing to intercept every \n",
      "glance directed toward her, a nd tried to appear the same \n",
      "as usual. \n",
      "After breakfast, which was her best time, Marya \n",
      "Dmitrievna sat down in her armchair and called Natasha \n",
      "and the count to her. \n",
      "‘Well, friends, I have now thought the whole matter \n",
      "over and this is my advice,’ she began. ‘Yesterday, as you \n",
      "know, I went to see Prince Bolkonski. Well, I had a talk \n",
      "with him.... He took it into his head to begin shouting, but \n",
      "I am not one to be shouted down. I said what I had to \n",
      "say!’ \n",
      "‘Well, and he?’ asked the count. \n",
      "‘He? He’s crazy... he did not want to listen. But what’s \n",
      "the use of talking? As it is we have worn the poor girl \n",
      "out,’ said Marya Dmitrievna. ‘My advice to you is finish War and Peace  \n",
      "1346 of 2882 \n",
      "your business and go back home to Otradnoe... and wait \n",
      "there.’ \n",
      "‘Oh, no!’ exclaimed Natasha. \n",
      "‘Yes, go back,’ said Marya Dmitrievna, ‘and wait \n",
      "there. If your betrothed come s here now- there will be no \n",
      "avoiding a quarrel; but alone with the old man he will talk \n",
      "things over and then come on to you.’ \n",
      "Count Rostov approved of  this suggestion, \n",
      "appreciating its reasonable ness. If the old man came \n",
      "round it would be all the better  to visit him in Moscow or \n",
      "at Bald Hills later on; and if not, the wedding, against his \n",
      "wishes, could only be arranged at Otradnoe. \n",
      "‘That is perfectly true. And I am sorry I went to see \n",
      "him and took her,’ said the old count. \n",
      "‘No, why be sorry? Being here, you had to pay your \n",
      "respects. But if he won’t- that’s his affair,’ said Marya \n",
      "Dmitrievna, looking for something in her reticule. \n",
      "‘Besides, the trouss eau is ready, so there is nothing to \n",
      "wait for; and what is not ready I’ll send after you. Though \n",
      "I don’t like letting you go, it is the best way. So go, with \n",
      "God’s blessing!’ \n",
      "Having found what she was l ooking for in the reticule \n",
      "she handed it to Natasha. It was a letter from Princess \n",
      "Mary. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1347 of 2882 \n",
      "‘She has written to you. How she torments herself, \n",
      "poor thing! She’s afraid you might think that she does not \n",
      "like you.’ \n",
      "‘But she doesn’t like me,’ said Natasha. \n",
      "‘Don’t talk nonsense!’ cried Marya Dmitrievna. \n",
      "‘I shan’t believe anyone, I know she doesn’t like me,’ \n",
      "replied Natasha boldly as she took the letter, and her face \n",
      "expressed a cold and angry re solution that caused Marya \n",
      "Dmitrievna to look at her more intently and to frown. \n",
      "‘Don’t answer like that, my good girl!’ she said. ‘What \n",
      "I say is true! Write an answer!’ Natasha did not reply and \n",
      "went to her own room to read Princess Mary’s letter. \n",
      "Princess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the \n",

      "who must be forgiven; but he is good and magnanimous \n",
      "and will love her who ma kes his son happy.’ Princess \n",

      "1348 of 2882 \n",
      "After reading the letter Natasha sat down at the writing \n",
      "table to answer it. ‘Dear Pr incess,’ she wrote in French \n",
      "quickly and mechanically, and then paused. What more \n",
      "could she write after all that had happened the evening \n",
      "before? ‘Yes, yes! All that has happened, and now all is \n",
      "changed,’ she thought as she sa t with the letter she had \n",
      "begun before her. ‘Must I break off with him? Must I \n",
      "really? That’s awful... and to  escape from these dreadful \n",

      "with her. \n",
      "After dinner Natasha went to  her room and again took \n",
      "up Princess Mary’s letter. ‘Can it be that it is all over?’ \n",

      "quickly and has destroyed al l that went before?’ She \n",
      "recalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its former \n",
      "strength, and at the same time felt that she loved Kuragin. \n",
      "She vividly pictured herself as  Prince Andrew’s wife, and \n",
      "the scenes of happiness with him she had so often \n",
      "repeated in her imagination, and at the same time, aglow \n",
      "with excitement, recalled ev ery detail of yesterday’s \n",
      "interview with Anatole. \n",
      "‘Why could that not be as well?’ she sometimes asked \n",
      "herself in complete bewilderment. ‘Only so could I be \n",

      "word, she understood only that it was a letter from him- \n",

      "Anatole rose and went into  the dining room. Balaga \n",
      "was a famous troyka driv er who had known Dolokhov \n",
      "and Anatole some six year s and had given them good \n",
      "service with his troykas. More than once when Anatole’s \n",
      "regiment was stationed at Tv er he had taken him from \n",
      "Tver in the evening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, \n",
      "and driven him back again the next night. More than once \n",
      "he had enabled Dolokhov to escape when pursued. More \n",
      "than once he had driven them through the town with \n",
      "gypsies and ‘ladykins’ as he  called the cocottes. More \n",
      "than once in their service he had run over pedestrians and \n",
      "upset vehicles in the streets of Moscow and had always \n",
      "been protected from the consequences by ‘my gentlemen’ \n",
      "as he called them. He had ruin ed more than one horse in \n",
      "their service. More than on ce they had beaten him, and \n",
      "more than once they had made him drunk on champagne \n",
      "and Madeira, which he loved; and he knew more than one \n",
      "thing about each of them which would long ago have sent \n",
      "an ordinary man to Siberia. They often called Balaga into \n",
      "their orgies and made him drink and dance at the gypsies’, \n",
      "and more than one thousand rubles of their money had \n",
      "passed through his hands. In th eir service he risked his \n",

      "had lost more horses than the money he had from them \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1367 of 2882 \n",
      "would buy. But he liked them; liked that mad driving at \n",
      "twelve miles an hour, liked ups etting a driver or running \n",
      "down a pedestrian, and flyi ng at full gallop through the \n",
      "Moscow streets. He liked to hear those wild, tipsy shouts \n",
      "behind him: ‘Get on! Get on!’ when it was impossible to \n",
      "go any faster. He liked giving a painful lash on the neck \n",
      "to some peasant who, more dead than alive, was already \n",
      "hurrying out of his way. ‘Real gentlemen!’ he considered \n",
      "them. \n",
      "Anatole and Dolokhov liked Balaga too for his \n",
      "masterly driving and because he liked the things they \n",
      "liked. With others Balaga bargained, charging twenty-five \n",
      "rubles for a two hours’ drive,  and rarely drove himself, \n",
      "generally letting his young men do so. But with ‘his \n",
      "gentlemen’ he always drove himself and never demanded \n",
      "anything for his work. Only a couple of times a year- \n",
      "when he knew from their valets that they had money in \n",
      "hand- he would turn up of a morning quite sober and with \n",
      "a deep bow would ask them to help him. The gentlemen \n",
      "always made him sit down. \n",
      "‘Do help me out, Theodore Ivanych, sir,’ or ‘your \n",

      "‘As your messenger ordered, your special beasts,’ \n",

      "‘Why joke?’ said the driv er, laughing. ‘As if I’d \n",

      "‘Ah!’ said Anatole. ‘Well, sit down.’ \n",
      "‘Yes, sit down!’ said Dolokhov. \n",
      "‘I’ll stand, Theodore Ivanych.’ \n",
      "‘Sit down; nonsense! Have a drink!’ said Anatole, and \n",
      "filled a large glass of Madeira for him. \n",
      "The driver’s eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine. \n",
      "After refusing it for manners’ sake, he drank it and wiped \n",

      "‘That depends on our luck in starting, else why \n",

      "that, your excellency?’ \n",
      "‘Do you know, one Christmas I drove from Tver,’ said \n",

      "1370 of 2882 \n",
      "eyes. ‘Will you believe it, Maka rka, it took one’s breath \n",
      "away, the rate we flew. We came across a train of loaded \n",
      "sleighs and drove right over two of them. Eh?’ \n",
      "‘Those were horses!’ Balaga continued the tale. ‘That \n",

      "yourself, your excellency!’ says I, and I just tumbled on \n",
      "the bottom of the sleigh and sprawled there. It wasn’t a \n",

      "minutes later wearing a fur coat girt with a silver belt, and \n",
      "a sable cap jauntily set on one  side and very becoming to \n",
      "his handsome face. Having looked in a mirror, and \n",
      "standing before Dolokhov in  the same pose he had \n",
      "assumed before it, he lifted a glass of wine. \n",
      "‘Well, good-by, Theodore. Thank you for everything \n",

      "Though they were all going with him, Anatole \n",

      "A handsome, slim, and pale-faced gypsy girl with \n",
      "glittering black eyes and curl y blue-black hair, wearing a \n",

      "‘Here, I don’t grudge it- take  it!’ she said, evidently \n",
      "afraid of her master and yet regretful of her cloak. \n",

      "1383 of 2882 \n",

      "unfortunate enough to be tied to a bad woman. But still he \n",

      "Anatole Kuragin, at the thought  of whom now the blood \n",

      "Komoneno’s. Pierre drove to the Club. In the Club all was \n",
      "going on as usual. The members who were assembling for \n",
      "dinner were sitting about in groups; they greeted Pierre \n",
      "and spoke of the town news. The footman having greeted \n",
      "him, knowing his habits and his acquaintances, told him \n",
      "there was a place left for him in the small dining room \n",
      "and that Prince Michael Zakharych was in the library, but \n",
      "Paul Timofeevich had not ye t arrived. One of Pierre’s \n",

      "asked if he had heard of Ku ragin’s abduction of Rostova \n",
      "which was talked of in the town, and was it true? Pierre \n",
      "laughed and said it was nonsense for he had just come \n",
      "from the Rostovs’. He asked everyone about Anatole. One \n",
      "man told him he had not come yet, and another that he \n",
      "was coming to dinner. Pierre felt it strange to see this \n",
      "calm, indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was \n",

      "waited till everyone had come, and as Anatole had not \n",
      "turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home. \n",

      "with Dolokhov, consulting him as to how to remedy this War and Peace  \n",
      "1390 of 2882 \n",
      "unfortunate affair. It seemed to him essential to see \n",
      "Natasha. In the evening he drove  to his sister’s to discuss \n",
      "with her how to arrange a meeting. When Pierre returned \n",
      "home after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet \n",
      "informed him that Prince An atole was with the countess. \n",

      "Anatole went up to him. \n",
      "‘Ah, Pierre,’ said the countess going up to her \n",

      "She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her \n",
      "husband’s head, in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait, \n",

      "‘Come now, this is stupid. What?’ said Anatole, \n",

      "‘You’re a scoundrel and a blackguard, and I don’t \n",
      "know what deprives me from the pleasure of smashing War and Peace  \n",

      "your head with this!’ said Pierre, expressing himself so \n",
      "artificially because he was talking French. \n",
      "He took a heavy paperw eight and lifted it \n",
      "threateningly, but at once put it back in its place. \n",
      "‘Did you promise to marry her?’ \n",
      "‘I... I didn’t think of it. I never promised, because..’ \n",

      "‘Have you any letters  of hers? Any letters?’ he said, \n",
      "moving toward Anatole. \n",
      "Anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his \n",
      "hand into his pocket and drew out his pocketbook. \n",
      "Pierre took the letter Anat ole handed him and, pushing \n",
      "aside a table that stood in his way, threw himself on the \n",
      "sofa. \n",
      "‘I shan’t be violent, don’t be afraid!’ said Pierre in \n",
      "answer to a frightened gesture of Anatole’s. ‘First, the \n",

      "‘Secondly,’ he continued after a short pause, again rising \n",
      "and again pacing the room, ‘tomorrow you must get out \n",

      "‘But how can I?..’ \n",
      "‘Thirdly,’ Pierre continued without listening to him, \n",
      "‘you must never breathe a word of what has passed \n",
      "between you and Countess Rostova. I know I can’t \n",

      "more confident as Pierre mastered his wrath. ‘I don’t \n",

      "Prince Meshcherski had left, Prince Andrew took Pierre’s \n",

      "him. A bed had been made up there, and some open \n",
      "portmanteaus and trunks stood about. Prince Andrew \n",
      "went to one and took out a sm all casket, from which he \n",

      "of a peasant’s hut, writing- he was auditing accounts. \n",
      "Better quarters could have been found him, but Marshal \n",
      "Davout was one of those men who purposely put \n",
      "themselves in most depre ssing conditions to have a \n",
      "justification for being gloomy. For the same reason they War and Peace  \n",
      "1442 of 2882 \n",
      "are always hard at work and in a hurry. ‘How can I think \n",
      "of the bright side of life wh en, as you see, I am sitting on \n",
      "a barrel and working in a dirty shed?’ the expression of \n",
      "his face seemed to say. The chief pleasure and necessity \n",
      "of such men, when they encounter anyone who shows \n",
      "animation, is to flaunt their own dreary, persistent \n",
      "activity. Davout allowed hims elf that pleasure when \n",
      "Balashev was brought in. He became still more absorbed \n",
      "in his task when the Russian  general entered, and after \n",
      "glancing over his spectacles at Balashev’s face, which \n",
      "was animated by the beauty of the morning and by his \n",
      "talk with Murat, he did not ri se or even stir, but scowled \n",
      "still more and sneered malevolently. \n",
      "When he noticed in Balashev’s face the disagreeable \n",
      "impression this reception produced, Davout raised his \n",
      "head and coldly asked what he wanted. \n",
      "Thinking he could have b een received in such a \n",
      "manner only because Davout di d not know that he was \n",
      "adjutant general to the Empe ror Alexander and even his \n",
      "envoy to Napoleon, Balashev hastened to inform him of \n",
      "his rank and mission. Contrary to his expectation, Davout, \n",
      "after hearing him, became still surlier and ruder. \n",
      "‘Where is your dispatch?’ he inquired. ‘Give it to me. I \n",
      "will send it to the Emperor.’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1443 of 2882 \n",
      "Balashev replied that he had been ordered to hand it \n",
      "personally to the Emperor. \n",
      "‘Your Emperor’s orders are obeyed in your army, but \n",
      "here,’ said Davout, ‘you must do as you’re told.’ \n",
      "And, as if to make the Russian general still more \n",
      "conscious of his dependence on  brute force, Davout sent \n",
      "an adjutant to call the officer on duty. \n",
      "Balashev took out the packet  containing the Emperor’s \n",
      "letter and laid it on the table (made of a door with its \n",
      "hinges still hanging on it, laid across two barrels). Davout \n",
      "took the packet and read the inscription. \n",
      "‘You are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or \n",
      "not,’ protested Balashev, ‘but permit me to observe that I \n",
      "have the honor to be adjutant general to His Majesty...’ \n",
      "Davout glanced at him sile ntly and plainly derived \n",
      "pleasure from the signs of agitation and confusion which \n",
      "appeared on Balashev’s face. \n",
      "‘You will be treated as is fitting,’ said he and, putting \n",
      "the packet in his pocket, left the shed. \n",
      "A minute later the marshal’s adjutant, de Castres, came \n",
      "in and conducted Balashev to the quarters assigned him. \n",
      "That day he dined with the marshal, at the same board \n",
      "on the barrels. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1444 of 2882 \n",
      "Next day Davout rode out  early and, after asking \n",
      "Balashev to come to him, peremptorily requested him to \n",
      "remain there, to move on w ith the baggage train should \n",
      "orders come for it to move, and to talk to no one except \n",
      "Monsieur de Castres. \n",
      "After four days of solit ude, ennui, and consciousness \n",
      "of his impotence and insignifican ce- particularly acute by \n",
      "contrast with the sphere of  power in which he had so \n",
      "lately moved- and after several marches with the \n",
      "marshal’s baggage and the French army, which occupied \n",
      "the whole district, Balashev was brought to Vilna- now \n",
      "occupied by the French- through the very gate by which \n",
      "he had left it four days previously. \n",
      "Next day the imperial gentleman-in-waiting, the Comte \n",
      "de Turenne, came to Balashev and informed him of the \n",
      "Emperor Napoleon’s wish to honor him with an audience. \n",
      "Four days before, sentinels of the Preobrazhensk \n",
      "regiment had stood in front of the house to which \n",
      "Balashev was conducted, and now two French grenadiers \n",
      "stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with \n",
      "shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and \n",
      "Uhlans and a brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and \n",
      "generals, who were waiting for Napoleon to come out, \n",
      "were standing at the porch, round his saddle horse and his \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1445 of 2882 \n",
      "Mameluke, Rustan. Napoleon received Balashev in the \n",

      "him on his mission. War and Peace  \n",
      "1446 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter VI \n",
      "Though Balashev was used to imperial pomp, he was \n",
      "amazed at the luxury and magnificence of Napoleon’s \n",
      "court. \n",
      "The Comte de Turenne showed him into a big \n",
      "reception room where many generals, gentlemen-in-\n",
      "waiting, and Polish magnates- several of whom Balashev \n",
      "had seen at the court of th e Emperor of Russia- were \n",
      "waiting. Duroc said that Napoleon would receive the \n",
      "Russian general before going for his ride. \n",
      "After some minutes, the gentleman-in-waiting who \n",
      "was on duty came into the great reception room and, \n",
      "bowing politely, asked Balashev to follow him. \n",
      "Balashev went into a small reception room, one door \n",
      "of which led into a study, th e very one from which the \n",
      "Russian Emperor had dispatched him on his mission. He \n",
      "stood a minute or two, waiting. He heard hurried footsteps \n",
      "beyond the door, both halves of it were opened rapidly; \n",
      "all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard \n",
      "of other steps, firm and re solute- they were those of \n",
      "Napoleon. He had just finished  dressing for his ride, and \n",
      "wore a blue uniform, openi ng in front over a white \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1447 of 2882 \n",
      "waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach, \n",
      "white leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his \n",
      "short legs, and Hessian boots. His short hair had evidently \n",
      "just been brushed, but one lock hung down in the middle \n",
      "of his broad forehead. His plump white neck stood out \n",
      "sharply above the black collar of his uniform, and he \n",
      "smelled of Eau de Cologne. His full face, rather young-\n",
      "looking, with its prominent chin, wore a gracious and \n",
      "majestic expression of imperial welcome. \n",
      "He entered briskly, with a jerk at every step and his \n",
      "head slightly thrown back. His whole short corpulent \n",
      "figure with broad thick shoul ders, and chest and stomach \n",
      "involuntarily protruding, had that imposing and stately \n",
      "appearance one sees in men of  forty who live in comfort. \n",
      "It was evident, too, that he wa s in the best of spirits that \n",
      "day. \n",
      "He nodded in answer to Bala shav’s low and respectful \n",
      "bow, and coming up to him at  once began speaking like a \n",
      "man who values every moment of his time and does not \n",
      "condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure he \n",
      "will always say the right thing and say it well. \n",
      "‘Good day, General!’ said he . ‘I have received the \n",
      "letter you brought from the Emperor Alexander and am War and Peace  \n",
      "1448 of 2882 \n",
      "very glad to see you.’ He glanced with his large eyes into \n",
      "Balashav’s face and immediately looked past him. \n",
      "It was plain that Balashev’s personality did not interest \n",
      "him at all. Evidently only what  took place within his own \n",
      "mind interested him. Nothing outside himself had any \n",
      "significance for him, because everything in the world, it \n",
      "seemed to him, depended entirely on his will. \n",
      "‘I do not, and did not, desire war,’ he continued, ‘but it \n",
      "has been forced on me. Even now’ (he emphasized the \n",
      "word) ‘I am ready to rece ive any explanations you can \n",
      "give me.’ \n",
      "And he began clearly and concisely to explain his \n",
      "reasons for dissatisfaction with the Russian government. \n",
      "Judging by the calmly moderate and amicable tone in \n",
      "which the French Emperor spoke, Balashev was firmly \n",
      "persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter \n",
      "into negotiations. \n",
      "When Napoleon, having finished speaking, looked \n",
      "inquiringly at the Russian envoy, Balashev began a \n",
      "speech he had prepared long before: ‘Sire! The Emperor, \n",
      "my master...’ but the sight of the Emperor’s eyes bent on \n",
      "him confused him. ‘You are flurried- compose yourself!’ \n",
      "Napoleon seemed to say, as with a scarcely perceptible \n",
      "smile he looked at Balashev’s uniform and sword. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1449 of 2882 \n",
      "Balashev recovered himself and began to speak. He \n",
      "said that the Emperor Alexander did not consider \n",
      "Kurakin’s demand for his passports a sufficient cause for \n",
      "war; that Kurakin had acted  on his own initiative and \n",
      "without his sovereign’s assent, that the Emperor \n",
      "Alexander did not desire war, and had no relations with \n",
      "England. \n",
      "‘Not yet!’ interposed Napol eon, and, as if fearing to \n",
      "give vent to his feelings, he frowned and nodded slightly \n",
      "as a sign that Balashev might proceed. \n",
      "After saying all he had been instructed to say, \n",
      "Balashev added that the Emperor Alexander wished for \n",
      "peace, but would not enter in to negotiations except on \n",
      "condition that... Here Balashev hesitated: he remembered \n",
      "the words the Emperor Alexander had not written in his \n",
      "letter, but had specially inserted in the rescript to Saltykov \n",
      "and had told Balashev to repeat to Napoleon. Balashev \n",
      "remembered these words, ‘So long as a single armed foe \n",
      "remains on Russian soil,’ but some complex feeling \n",
      "restrained him. He could not utter them, though he wished \n",
      "to do so. He grew confused and said: ‘On condition that \n",
      "the French army retires beyond the Niemen.’ \n",
      "Napoleon noticed Balashev’s embarrassment when \n",
      "uttering these last words; his face twitched and the calf of War and Peace  \n",
      "1450 of 2882 \n",
      "his left leg began to quiver rhythmically. Without moving \n",
      "from where he stood he began speaking in a louder tone \n",
      "and more hurriedly than before. During the speech that \n",
      "followed, Balashev, who more than once lowered his \n",
      "eyes, involuntarily noticed the quivering of Napoleon’s \n",
      "left leg which increased the more Napoleon raised his \n",
      "voice. \n",
      "‘I desire peace, no less than the Emperor Alexander,’ \n",
      "he began. ‘Have I not for eighteen months been doing \n",
      "everything to obtain it? I have waited eighteen months for \n",
      "explanations. But in order to  begin negotiations, what is \n",
      "demanded of me?’ he sai d, frowning and making an \n",
      "energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump \n",
      "hand. \n",
      "‘The withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, \n",
      "sire,’ replied Balashev. \n",
      "‘The Niemen?’ repeated Napoleon. ‘So now you want \n",
      "me to retire beyond the Niemen- only the Niemen?’ \n",
      "repeated Napoleon, looking straight at Balashev. \n",
      "The latter bowed his head respectfully. \n",
      "Instead of the demand of four months earlier to \n",
      "withdraw from Pomerania, only a withdrawal beyond the \n",
      "Niemen was now demanded. Napoleon turned quickly \n",
      "and began to pace the room. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1451 of 2882 \n",
      "‘You say the demand now is that I am to withdraw \n",
      "beyond the Niemen before commencing negotiations, but \n",
      "in just the same way two months ago the demand was that \n",
      "I should withdraw beyond the Vistula and the Oder, and \n",
      "yet you are willing to negotiate.’ \n",
      "He went in silence from one corner of the room to the \n",
      "other and again stopped in front of Balashev. Balashev \n",
      "noticed that his left leg was quivering faster than before \n",
      "and his face seemed petrified in its stern expression. This \n",
      "quivering of his left leg was a thing Napoleon was \n",
      "conscious of. ‘The vibration of my left calf is a great sign \n",
      "with me,’ he remarked at a later date. \n",
      "‘Such demands as to retreat beyond the Vistula and \n",
      "Oder may be made to a Prince of Baden, but not to me!’ \n",
      "Napoleon almost screamed, quite to his own surprise. ‘If \n",
      "you gave me Petersburg and Moscow I could not accept \n",
      "such conditions. You say I have  begun this war! But who \n",
      "first joined his army? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And \n",
      "you offer me negotiations when I have expended millions, \n",
      "when you are in alliance with England, and when your \n",
      "position is a bad one. You offer me negotiations! But \n",
      "what is the aim of your allian ce with England? What has \n",
      "she given you?’ he continue d hurriedly, evidently no \n",
      "longer trying to show the advantages of peace and discuss War and Peace  \n",
      "1452 of 2882 \n",
      "its possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and \n",
      "power and Alexander’s errors and duplicity. \n",
      "The commencement of his speech had obviously been \n",
      "made with the intention of demonstrating the advantages \n",
      "of his position and showing that he was nevertheless \n",
      "willing to negotiate. But he had begun talking, and the \n",
      "more he talked the less could he control his words. \n",
      "The whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to \n",
      "exalt himself and insult Alexa nder- just what he had least \n",
      "desired at the commencement of the interview. \n",
      "‘I hear you have made peace with Turkey?’ \n",
      "Balashev bowed his head affirmatively. \n",
      "‘Peace has been concluded...’ he began. \n",
      "But Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently \n",
      "wanted to do all the talking himself, and continued to talk \n",
      "with the sort of eloquence and unrestrained irritability to \n",
      "which spoiled people are so prone. \n",
      "‘Yes, I know you have made peace with the Turks \n",
      "without obtaining Moldavia and Wallachia; I would have \n",
      "given your sovereign those provinces as I gave him \n",
      "Finland. Yes,’ he went on, ‘I promised and would have \n",
      "given the Emperor Alexander Moldavia and Wallachia, \n",
      "and now he won’t have those splendid provinces. Yet he \n",
      "might have united them to his empire and in a single reign \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1453 of 2882 \n",
      "would have extended Russia from  the Gulf of Bothnia to \n",
      "the mouths of the Danube. Catherine the Great could not \n",
      "have done more,’ said Napoleon, growing more and more \n",
      "excited as he paced up and down the room, repeating to \n",
      "Balashev almost the very words he had used to Alexander \n",
      "himself at Tilsit. ‘All that, he would have owed to my \n",
      "friendship. Oh, what a sple ndid reign!’ he repeated \n",
      "several times, then paused, drew from his pocket a gold \n",
      "snuffbox, lifted it to his nose, and greedily sniffed at it. \n",
      "‘What a splendid reign the Emperor Alexander’s might \n",
      "have been!’ \n",
      "He looked compassionately at Balashev, and as soon as \n",
      "the latter tried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted \n",
      "him. \n",
      "‘What could he wish or look for that he would not have \n",
      "obtained through my friends hip?’ demanded Napoleon, \n",
      "shrugging his shoulders in perplexity. ‘But no, he has \n",
      "preferred to surround himself w ith my enemies, and with \n",
      "whom? With Steins, Armfeldts, Bennigsens, and \n",
      "Wintzingerodes! Stein, a tra itor expelled from his own \n",
      "country; Armfeldt, a rake  and an intriguer; \n",
      "Wintzingerode, a fugitive French subject; Bennigsen, \n",
      "rather more of a soldier than the others, but all the same \n",
      "an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807 War and Peace  \n",
      "1454 of 2882 \n",
      "and who should awaken terrible memories in the Emperor \n",
      "Alexander’s mind.... Granted th at were they competent \n",
      "they might be made use of,’ continued Napoleon- hardly \n",
      "able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts that \n",
      "incessantly sprang up, proving how right and strong he \n",
      "was (in his perception the two were one and the same)- \n",
      "‘but they are not even that! They are neither fit for war \n",
      "nor peace! Barclay is said to be the most capable of them \n",
      "all, but I cannot say so, judgi ng by his first movements. \n",
      "And what are they doing, all these courtiers? Pfuel \n",
      "proposes, Armfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and \n",
      "Barclay, called on to act, does not know what to decide \n",
      "on, and time passes bringing no re sult. Bagration alone is \n",
      "a military man. He’s stupid, but he has experience, a \n",
      "quick eye, and resolution.... A nd what role is your young \n",
      "monarch playing in that monstrous crowd? They \n",
      "compromise him and throw on him the responsibility for \n",
      "all that happens. A sovereign should not be with the army \n",
      "unless he is a general!’ said  Napoleon, evidently uttering \n",
      "these words as a direct challenge to the Emperor. He \n",
      "knew how Alexander desired to be a military commander. \n",
      "‘The campaign began only a week ago, and you \n",
      "haven’t even been able to defend Vilna. You are cut in \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1455 of 2882 \n",
      "two and have been driven out of the Polish provinces. \n",
      "Your army is grumbling.’ \n",
      "‘On the contrary, Your Majesty,’ said Balashev, hardly \n",
      "able to remember what had been said to him and \n",
      "following these verbal fireworks with difficulty, ‘the \n",
      "troops are burning with eagerness..’ \n",
      "‘I know everything!’ Napole on interrupted him. ‘I \n",
      "know everything. I know the number of your battalions as \n",
      "exactly as I know my own. You have not two hundred \n",
      "thousand men, and I have three times that number. I give \n",
      "you my word of honor,’ said Napoleon, forgetting that his \n",
      "word of honor could carry no weight- ‘I give you my \n",
      "word of honor that I have  five hundred and thirty \n",
      "thousand men this side of the Vistula. The Turks will be \n",
      "of no use to you; they are wo rth nothing and have shown \n",
      "it by making peace with you. As for the Swedes- it is their \n",
      "fate to be governed by mad kings. Their king was insane \n",
      "and they changed him for another- Bernadotte, who \n",
      "promptly went mad- for no Swede would ally himself \n",
      "with Russia unless he were mad.’ \n",
      "Napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his \n",
      "snuffbox to his nose. \n",
      "Balashev knew how to reply to each of Napoleon’s \n",
      "remarks, and would have done so; he continually made \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1456 of 2882 \n",
      "the gesture of a man wishing to say something, but \n",
      "Napoleon always interrupted hi m. To the alleged insanity \n",
      "of the Swedes, Balashev wished to reply that when Russia \n",
      "is on her side Sweden is practically an island: but \n",
      "Napoleon gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice. \n",
      "Napoleon was in that state of irritability in which a man \n",
      "has to talk, talk, and talk, me rely to convince himself that \n",
      "he is in the right. Balashev began to feel uncomfortable: \n",
      "as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and felt the \n",
      "necessity of replying; but, as a man, he shrank before the \n",
      "transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized \n",
      "Napoleon. He knew that none of the words now uttered \n",
      "by Napoleon had any signifi cance, and that Napoleon \n",
      "himself would be ashamed of them when he came to his \n",
      "senses. Balashev stood with downcast eyes, looking at the \n",
      "movements of Napoleon’s stou t legs and trying to avoid \n",
      "meeting his eyes. \n",
      "‘But what do I care about your allies?’ said Napoleon. \n",
      "‘I have allies- the Poles. There are eighty thousand of \n",
      "them and they fight like lions. And there will be two \n",
      "hundred thousand of them.’ \n",
      "And probably still more perturbed by the fact that he \n",
      "had uttered this obvious false hood, and that Balashev still \n",
      "stood silently before him in the same attitude of \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1457 of 2882 \n",
      "submission to fate, Napoleon ab ruptly turned round, drew \n",
      "close to Balashev’s face, a nd, gesticulating rapidly and \n",
      "energetically with his white hands, almost shouted: \n",
      "‘Know that if you stir up Pr ussia against me, I’ll wipe \n",
      "it off the map of Europe!’ he declared, his face pale and \n",
      "distorted by anger, and he struck one of his small hands \n",
      "energetically with the other.  ‘Yes, I will throw you back \n",
      "beyond the Dvina and beyond the Dnieper, and will re-\n",
      "erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and \n",
      "blind of Europe to allow to be destroyed. Yes, that is what \n",
      "will happen to you. That is what you have gained by \n",
      "alienating me!’ And he walked silently several times up \n",
      "and down the room, his fat shoulders twitching. \n",
      "He put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it \n",
      "out again, lifted it several times to his nose, and stopped \n",
      "in front of Balashev. He paused, looked ironically straight \n",
      "into Balashev’s eyes, and said in a quiet voice: \n",
      "‘And yet what a splendid reign your master might have \n",
      "had!’ \n",
      "Balashev, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said \n",
      "that from the Russian side th ings did not appear in so \n",
      "gloomy a light. Napoleon wa s silent, still looking \n",
      "derisively at him and eviden tly not listening to him. \n",
      "Balashev said that in Russia the best results were War and Peace  \n",
      "1458 of 2882 \n",
      "expected from the war. Napoleon nodded \n",
      "condescendingly, as if to say, ‘I know it’s your duty to \n",
      "say that, but you don’t beli eve it yourself. I have \n",
      "convinced you.’ \n",
      "When Balashev had ended, Napoleon again took out \n",
      "his snuffbox, sniffed at it, a nd stamped his foot twice on \n",
      "the floor as a signal. The door opened, a gentleman-in-\n",
      "waiting, bending respectfully, handed the Emperor his hat \n",
      "and gloves; another brought hima pocket handkerchief. \n",
      "Napoleon, without giving them a glance, turned to \n",
      "Balashev: \n",
      "‘Assure the Emperor Alexander from me,’ said he, \n",
      "taking his hat, ‘that I am as devoted to him as before: I \n",
      "know him thoroughly and very highly esteem his lofty \n",
      "qualities. I will detain you no longer, General; you shall \n",
      "receive my letter to the Emperor.’ \n",
      "And Napoleon went quickly to the door. Everyone in \n",
      "the reception room rushed forward and descended the \n",
      "staircase. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1459 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter VII \n",
      "After all that Napoleon had said to him- those bursts of \n",
      "anger and the last dryly spoke n words: ‘I will detain you \n",
      "no longer, General; you shall re ceive my letter,’ Balashev \n",
      "felt convinced that Napoleon w ould not wish to see him, \n",
      "and would even avoid another meeting with him- an \n",
      "insulted envoy- especially as he had witnessed his \n",
      "unseemly anger. But, to his surprise, Balashev received, \n",
      "through Duroc, an invitation to dine with the Emperor that \n",
      "day. \n",
      "Bessieres, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were present at \n",
      "that dinner. \n",
      "Napoleon met Balashev cheerfully and amiably. He \n",
      "not only showed no sign of c onstraint or self-reproach on \n",
      "account of his outburst that morning, but, on the contrary, \n",
      "tried to reassure Balashev. It was evident that he had long \n",
      "been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a \n",
      "mistake, and that in his pe rception whatever he did was \n",
      "right, not because it harmonized with any idea of right \n",
      "and wrong, but because he did it. \n",
      "The Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride \n",
      "through Vilna, where crowds of people had rapturously War and Peace  \n",
      "1460 of 2882 \n",
      "greeted and followed him. From all the windows of the \n",
      "streets through which he ro de, rugs, flags, and his \n",
      "monogram were displayed, and the Polish ladies, \n",
      "welcoming him, waved their handkerchiefs to him. \n",
      "At dinner, having placed Balashev beside him, \n",
      "Napoleon not only treated him amiably but behaved as if \n",
      "Balashev were one of his own courtiers, one of those who \n",
      "sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at his \n",
      "success. In the course of conversation he mentioned \n",
      "Moscow and questioned Balashev about the Russian \n",
      "capital, not merely as an inte rested traveler asks about a \n",
      "new city he intends to visit, but as if convinced that \n",
      "Balashev, as a Russian, must be flattered by his curiosity. \n",
      "‘How many inhabitants ar e there in Moscow? How \n",
      "many houses? Is it true that Moscow is called ‘Holy \n",
      "Moscow’? How many churches are there in Moscow?’ he \n",
      "asked. \n",
      "And receiving the reply that there were more than two \n",
      "hundred churches, he remarked: \n",
      "‘Why such a quantity of churches?’ \n",
      "‘The Russians are very devout,’ replied Balashev. \n",
      "‘But a large number of m onasteries and churches is \n",
      "always a sign of the backwa rdness of a people,’ said \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1461 of 2882 \n",
      "Napoleon, turning to Caulaincourt for appreciation of this \n",
      "remark. \n",
      "Balashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the \n",
      "French Emperor. \n",
      "‘Every country has its own character,’ said he. \n",
      "‘But nowhere in Europe is there anything like that,’ \n",
      "said Napoleon. \n",
      "‘I beg your Majesty’s par don,’ returned Balashev, \n",
      "‘besides Russia there is Spain, where there are also many \n",
      "churches and monasteries.’ \n",
      "This reply of Balashev’s, which hinted at the recent \n",
      "defeats of the French in Spain, was much appreciated \n",
      "when he related it at Alexa nder’s court, but it was not \n",
      "much appreciated at Napoleon’s dinner, where it passed \n",
      "unnoticed. \n",
      "The uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals \n",
      "showed that they were puzzled as to what Balashev’s tone \n",
      "suggested. ‘If there is a point we don’t see it, or it is not at \n",
      "all witty,’ their expressions seemed to say. So little was \n",
      "his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon did not notice it at \n",
      "all and naively asked Balash ev through what towns the \n",
      "direct road from there to Moscow passed. Balashev, who \n",
      "was on the alert all through the dinner, replied that just as \n",
      "‘all roads lead to Rome,’ so all roads lead to Moscow: War and Peace  \n",
      "1462 of 2882 \n",
      "there were many roads, a nd ‘among them the road \n",
      "through Poltava, which Charles XII chose.’ Balashev \n",
      "involuntarily flushed with pleasur e at the aptitude of this \n",
      "reply, but hardly had he utte red the word Poltava before \n",
      "Caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road \n",
      "from Petersburg to Moscow  and of his Petersburg \n",
      "reminiscences. \n",
      "After dinner they went to drink coffee in Napoleon’s \n",
      "study, which four days previously had been that of the \n",
      "Emperor Alexander. Napoleon sat down, toying with his \n",
      "Sevres coffee cup, and motioned Balashev to a chair \n",
      "beside him. \n",
      "Napoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood \n",
      "which, more than any reasoned cause, makes a man \n",
      "contented with himself and disposed to consider everyone \n",
      "his friend. It seemed to him that he was surrounded by \n",
      "men who adored him: and he felt convinced that, after his \n",
      "dinner, Balashev too was his friend and worshiper. \n",
      "Napoleon turned to him with a pleasant, though slightly \n",
      "ironic, smile. \n",
      "‘They tell me this is the room the Emperor Alexander \n",
      "occupied? Strange, isn’t it, General?’ he said, evidently \n",
      "not doubting that this remark would be agreeable to his \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1463 of 2882 \n",
      "hearer since it went to prove his, Napoleon’s, superiority \n",
      "to Alexander. \n",
      "Balashev made no reply and bowed and bowed his \n",
      "head in silence. \n",
      "‘Yes. Four days ago in this room, Wintzingerode and \n",
      "Stein were deliberating,’ c ontinued Napoleon with the \n",
      "same derisive and self-confident smile. ‘What I can’t \n",
      "understand,’ he went on, ‘is that the Emperor Alexander \n",
      "has surrounded himself with my personal enemies. That I \n",
      "do not... understand. Has he not thought that I may the \n",
      "same?’ and he turned inquiringly to Balashev, and \n",
      "evidently this thought turned him back on to the track of \n",
      "his morning’s anger, which was still fresh in him. \n",
      "‘And let him know that I will do so!’ said Napoleon, \n",
      "rising and pushing his cup aw ay with his hand. ‘I’ll drive \n",
      "all his Wurttemberg, Baden, and Weimar relations out of \n",
      "Germany.... Yes. I’ll drive them out. Let him prepare an \n",
      "asylum for them in Russia!’ \n",
      "Balashev bowed his head with an air indicating that he \n",
      "would like to make his bow a nd leave, and only listened \n",
      "because he could not help hear ing what was said to him. \n",
      "Napoleon did not notice this  expression; he treated \n",
      "Balashev not as an envoy from his enemy, but as a man War and Peace  \n",
      "1464 of 2882 \n",
      "now fully devoted to him a nd who must rejoice at his \n",

      "of the armies? What is the good of that? War is my \n",

      "command armies! Why has he taken on himself such a \n",
      "responsibility?’ \n",
      "Again Napoleon brought out his snuffbox, paced \n",
      "several times up and down the room in silence, and then, \n",
      "suddenly and unexpectedly, went up to Balashev and with \n",
      "a slight smile, as confidently, qu ickly, and simply as if he \n",
      "were doing something not merely important but pleasing \n",
      "to Balashev, he raised his hand to the forty-year-old \n",
      "Russian general’s face and, taking him by the ear, pulled \n",

      "To have one’s ear pulled by the Emperor was \n",

      "‘Well, adorer and courtier of the Emperor Alexander, \n",

      "The letter taken by Balashev was the last Napoleon \n",

      "After his interview with Pierre in Moscow, Prince \n",
      "Andrew went to Petersburg, on business as he told his \n",

      "it necessary to encounter. On reaching Petersburg he \n",
      "inquired for Kuragin but the latter had already left the \n",
      "city. Pierre had warned hi s brother-in-law that Prince \n",
      "Andrew was on his track. Anatole Kuragin promptly \n",
      "obtained an appointment from  the Minister of War and \n",
      "went to join the army in Moldavia. While in Petersburg \n",

      "new country, amid new condi tions, Prince Andrew found \n",
      "life easier to bear. After his betrothed had broken faith \n",
      "with him- which he felt the more acutely the more he tried \n",
      "to conceal its effects- the surroundings in which he had \n",
      "been happy became trying to him, and the freedom and \n",
      "independence he had once pri zed so highly were still \n",
      "more so. Not only could he no longer think the thoughts \n",

      "the field of Austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with \n",
      "Pierre, and which had filled his solitude at Bogucharovo \n",
      "and then in Switzerland and Rome, but he even dreaded to \n",
      "recall them and them a nd the bright and boundless \n",
      "horizons they had revealed. He was now concerned only \n",
      "with the nearest practical matters unrelated to his past \n",
      "interests, and he seized on these the more eagerly the \n",
      "more those past interests were closed to him. It was as if \n",
      "that lofty, infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered \n",
      "above him had suddenly turned into a low, solid vault that \n",

      "eternal or mysterious. \n",
      "Of the activities that presented themselves to him, \n",

      "he did meet him he would not be able to resist calling him \n",
      "out, any more than a ravenous man can help snatching at \n",
      "food. And the consciousness that the insult was not yet \n",
      "avenged, that his rancor was still unspent, weighed on his \n",
      "heart and poisoned the artifi cial tranquillity which he \n",
      "managed to obtain in Turkey by means of restless, \n",
      "plodding, and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity. \n",
      "In the year 1812, when news of the war with Napoleon \n",

      "Hills which was directly on his way, being only two miles \n",
      "off the Smolensk highroad. During the last three years \n",
      "there had been so many changes in his life, he had \n",
      "thought, felt, and seen so much (having traveled both in \n",
      "the east and the west), that on reaching Bald Hills it struck \n",
      "him as strange and unexpect ed to find the way of life \n",
      "there unchanged and still the same in every detail. He \n",
      "entered through the gates with their stone pillars and \n",
      "drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were \n",
      "entering an enchanted, sleeping castle. The same old \n",
      "stateliness, the same cleanliness, the same stillness \n",
      "reigned there, and inside there was the same furniture, the \n",
      "same walls, sounds, and smell, and the same timid faces, \n",
      "only somewhat older. Princess Mary was still the same \n",
      "timid, plain maiden getting on in years, uselessly and \n",
      "joylessly passing the best year s of her life in fear and \n",
      "constant suffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne was the same \n",
      "coquettish, self-satisfied girl , enjoying every moment of \n",
      "her existence and full of joyous hopes for the future. She \n",
      "had merely become more se lf-confident, Prince Andrew \n",
      "thought. Dessalles, the tuto r he had brought from \n",
      "Switzerland, was wearing a coat of Russian cut and War and Peace  \n",
      "1470 of 2882 \n",
      "talking broken Russian to the servants, but was still the \n",
      "same narrowly intelligent, conscientious, and pedantic \n",
      "preceptor. The old prince had changed in appearance only \n",
      "by the loss of a tooth, which left a noticeable gap on one \n",
      "side of his mouth; in charac ter he was the same as ever, \n",
      "only showing still more irrita bility and skepticism as to \n",
      "what was happening in the wo rld. Little Nicholas alone \n",
      "had changed. He had grown, become rosier, had curly \n",
      "dark hair, and, when merry and laughing, quite \n",
      "unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth \n",
      "just as the little princess used to do. He alone did not obey \n",
      "the law of immutability in the enchanted, sleeping castle. \n",
      "But though externally all remained as of old, the inner \n",
      "relations of all these people had changed since Prince \n",
      "Andrew had seen them last . The household was divided \n",
      "into two alien and hostile camps, who changed their \n",
      "habits for his sake and only met because he was there. To \n",
      "the one camp belonged the old prince, Madmoiselle \n",
      "Bourienne, and the architect; to the other Princess Mary, \n",
      "Dessalles, little Nicholas, and all the old nurses and \n",
      "maids. \n",
      "During his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined \n",
      "together, but they were ill at ease and Prince Andrew felt \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1471 of 2882 \n",
      "being made and that his pres ence made them all feel \n",
      "awkward. Involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first \n",
      "day, he was taciturn, and the old prince noticing this also \n",
      "became morosely dumb and retired to his apartments \n",
      "directly after dinner. In the evening, when Prince Andrew \n",
      "went to him and, trying to r ouse him, began to tell him of \n",
      "the young Count Kamensky’s campaign, the old prince \n",
      "began unexpectedly to talk about Princess Mary, blaming \n",
      "her for her superstitions and her dislike of Mademoiselle \n",
      "Bourienne, who, he said, wa s the only person really \n",
      "attached to him. \n",
      "The old prince said that if he was ill it was only \n",
      "because of Princess Mary: that she purposely worried and \n",
      "irritated him, and that by indulgence and silly talk she was \n",
      "spoiling little Prince Nicholas. The old prince knew very \n",
      "well that he tormented his daughter and that her life was \n",
      "very hard, but he also kne w that he could not help \n",
      "tormenting her and that she deserved it. ‘Why does Prince \n",
      "Andrew, who sees this, say nothing to me about his sister? \n",
      "Does he think me a scoundrel, or an old fool who, without \n",
      "any reason, keeps his own daughter at a distance and \n",
      "attaches this Frenchwoman to himself? He doesn’t \n",
      "understand, so I must explain it, and he must hear me \n",
      "out,’ thought the old prince.  And he began explaining War and Peace  \n",
      "1472 of 2882 \n",
      "why he could not put up w ith his daughter’s unreasonable \n",
      "character. \n",
      "‘If you ask me,’ said Prin ce Andrew, without looking \n",
      "up (he was censuring his father for the first time in his \n",
      "life), ‘I did not wish to speak about it, but as you ask me I \n",
      "will give you my frank opinion. If there is any \n",
      "misunderstanding and discord between you and Mary, I \n",
      "can’t blame her for it at all. I know how she loves and \n",
      "respects you. Since you as k me,’ continued Prince \n",
      "Andrew, becoming irritable- as he was always liable to do \n",
      "of late- ‘I can only say that if there are any \n",

      "woman, who is not fit to be my sister’s companion.’ \n",
      "The old man at first stared fixedly at his son, and an \n",
      "unnatural smile disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth \n",
      "to which Prince Andrew could not get accustomed. \n",
      "‘What companion, my dear boy? Eh? You’ve already \n",
      "been talking it over! Eh?’ \n",
      "‘Father, I did not want to judge,’ said Prince Andrew, \n",

      "second army was retreating, tr ying to effect a junction \n",
      "with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by \n",

      "Petersburg, but Prince Andrew was glad to hear this. His \n",
      "mind was occupied by the interests of the center that was \n",

      "a while from the distraction caused by the thought of \n",

      "by talks with experts, tried to form a definite opinion \n",
      "about it. But the question whether the camp was \n",
      "advantageous or disadvantageous remained for him \n",
      "undecided. Already from his military experience and what \n",
      "he had seen in the Austrian campaign, he had come to the \n",
      "conclusion that in war the most deeply considered plans \n",
      "have no significance and th at all depends on the way \n",
      "unexpected movements of the enemy- that cannot be \n",
      "foreseen- are met, and on how and by whom the whole \n",
      "matter is handled. To clear up this last point for himself, \n",
      "Prince Andrew, utilizing his position and acquaintances, \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1480 of 2882 \n",
      "While the Emperor had still been at Vilna, the forces \n",
      "had been divided into three armies. First, the army under \n",
      "Barclay de Tolly, secondly, the army under Bagration, \n",
      "and thirdly, the one commanded by Tormasov. The \n",
      "Emperor was with the first army, but not as commander in \n",
      "chief. In the orders issued it was stated, not that the \n",
      "Emperor would take command, but only that he would be \n",
      "with the army. The Emperor, moreover, had with him not \n",
      "a commander in chief’s staff but the imperial headquarters \n",
      "staff. In attendance on him was the head of the imperial \n",
      "staff, Quartermaster General Prince Volkonski, as well as \n",
      "generals, imperial aides-de-cam p, diplomatic officials, \n",
      "and a large number of foreigne rs, but not the army staff. \n",
      "Besides these, there were in attendance on the Emperor \n",
      "without any definite appoint ments: Arakcheev, the ex-\n",

      "adjutant general and Sardinian emigre; Wolzogen- and \n",
      "many others. Though these men had no military \n",
      "appointment in the army, their position gave them \n",
      "influence, and often a corps commander, or even the \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1481 of 2882 \n",
      "commander in chief, did not know in what capacity he \n",

      "Arakcheev, or Prince Volkonski, or was given this or that \n",
      "advice and did not know whethe r a certain order received \n",
      "in the form of advice emanated  from the man who gave it \n",
      "or from the Emperor and whether it had to be executed or \n",

      "these people, from a courtier’s  point of view (and in an \n",
      "Emperor’s vicinity all becam e courtiers), was clear to \n",
      "everyone. It was this: the Emperor did not assume the title \n",
      "of commander in chief, but disposed of all the armies; the \n",
      "men around him were his as sistants. Arakcheev was a \n",
      "faithful custodian to enforce order and acted as the \n",
      "sovereign’s bodyguard. Bennigsen was a landlord in the \n",
      "Vilna province who appeared to be doing the honors of \n",
      "the district, but was in reality a good general, useful as an \n",
      "adviser and ready at hand to  replace Barclay. The Grand \n",
      "Duke was there because it suited him to be. The ex-\n",
      "Minister Stein was there because his advice was useful \n",
      "and the Emperor Alexander held him in high esteem \n",
      "personally. Armfeldt virulently hated Napoleon and was a \n",
      "general full of self-confide nce, a quality that always \n",
      "influenced Alexander. Paulucci was there because he was War and Peace  \n",
      "1482 of 2882 \n",
      "bold and decided in speech. The adjutants general were \n",
      "there because they always accompanied the Emperor, and \n",
      "lastly and chiefly Pfuel was there because he had drawn \n",
      "up the plan of campaign ag ainst Napoleon and, having \n",
      "induced Alexander to believe in  the efficacy of that plan, \n",
      "was directing the whole business of the war. With Pfuel \n",
      "was Wolzogen, who expressed Pfuel’s thoughts in a more \n",
      "comprehensible way than Pfuel himself (who was a harsh, \n",
      "bookish theorist, self-confident to the point of despising \n",
      "everyone else) was able to do. \n",
      "Besides these Russians and foreigners who \n",
      "propounded new and unexpected  ideas every day- \n",
      "especially the foreigners, who did so with a boldness \n",
      "characteristic of people employed in a country not their \n",
      "own- there were many secondary personages \n",
      "accompanying the army because their principals were \n",
      "there. \n",
      "Among the opinions and voices in this immense, \n",
      "restless, brilliant, and pr oud sphere, Prince Andrew \n",
      "noticed the following sharply defined subdivisions of and \n",
      "parties: \n",
      "The first party consisted of  Pfuel and his adherents- \n",
      "military theorists who believed in a science of war with \n",
      "immutable laws- laws of  oblique movements, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1483 of 2882 \n",
      "outflankings, and so forth. Pfuel and his adherents \n",
      "demanded a retirement into the depths of the country in \n",
      "accordance with precise laws defined by a pseudo-theory \n",
      "of war, and they saw only barbarism, ignorance, or evil \n",
      "intention in every deviation from that theory. To this party \n",
      "belonged the foreign nobles , Wolzogen, Wintzingerode, \n",
      "and others, chiefly Germans. \n",
      "The second party was directly opposed to the first; one \n",
      "extreme, as always happens, was met by representatives \n",
      "of the other. The members of  this party were those who \n",
      "had demanded an advance from Vilna into Poland and \n",
      "freedom from all prearranged plans. Besides being \n",
      "advocates of bold action, this section also represented \n",
      "nationalism, which made them still more one-sided in the \n",
      "dispute. They were Russians: Bagration, Ermolov (who \n",
      "was beginning to come to the front), and others. At that \n",
      "time a famous joke of Ermo lov’s was being circulated, \n",
      "that as a great favor he ha d petitioned the Emperor to \n",
      "make him a German. The men of that party, remembering \n",
      "Suvorov, said that what one ha d to do was not to reason, \n",
      "or stick pins into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep \n",
      "him out of Russia, and not let the army get discouraged. \n",
      "To the third party- in wh ich the Emperor had most \n",
      "confidence- belonged the cour tiers who tried to arrange War and Peace  \n",
      "1484 of 2882 \n",
      "compromises between the other two. The members of this \n",
      "party, chiefly civilians and to whom Arakcheev belonged, \n",
      "thought and said what men who have no convictions but \n",
      "wish to seem to have some ge nerally say. They said that \n",
      "undoubtedly war, particularly against such a genius as \n",
      "Bonaparte (they called him Bonaparte now), needs most \n",
      "deeply devised plans and pr ofound scientific knowledge \n",
      "and in that respect Pfuel wa s a genius, but at the same \n",
      "time it had to be acknowledged th at the theorists are often \n",
      "one sided, and therefore one should not trust them \n",
      "absolutely, but should also listen to what Pfuel’s \n",
      "opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had \n",
      "to say, and then choose a middle course. They insisted on \n",
      "the retention of the camp at Drissa, according to Pfuel’s \n",
      "plan, but on changing the movements of the other armies. \n",
      "Though, by this course, neither one aim nor the other \n",
      "could be attained, yet it seemed best to the adherents of \n",
      "this third party. \n",
      "Of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous \n",
      "representative was the Tsarevich, who could not forget his \n",
      "disillusionment at Austerlitz, where he had ridden out at \n",
      "the head of the Guards, in his casque and cavalry uniform \n",
      "as to a review, expecting to  crush the French gallantly; \n",
      "but unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1485 of 2882 \n",
      "narrowly escaped amid the general confusion. The men of \n",
      "this party had both the qualit y and the defect of frankness \n",
      "in their opinions. They feared Napoleon, recognized his \n",
      "strength and their own weakness, and frankly said so. \n",
      "They said: ‘Nothing but sorro w, shame, and ruin will \n",
      "come of all this! We have abandoned Vilna and Vitebsk \n",
      "and shall abandon Drissa. The only reasonable thing left \n",
      "to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible, before we \n",
      "are turned out of Petersburg.’ \n",
      "This view was very genera l in the upper army circles \n",
      "and found support also in Petersburg and from the \n",
      "chancellor, Rumyantsev, who, fo r other reasons of state, \n",
      "was in favor of peace. \n",
      "The fifth party consisted of  those who were adherents \n",
      "of Barclay de Tolly, not so mu ch as a man but as minister \n",
      "of war and commander in chief. ‘Be he what he may’ \n",
      "(they always began like that),  ‘he is an honest, practical \n",
      "man and we have nobody better. Give him real power, for \n",
      "war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of \n",
      "command, and he will show what he can do, as he did in \n",
      "Finland. If our army is well organized and strong and has \n",
      "withdrawn to Drissa without  suffering any defeats, we \n",
      "owe this entirely to Barclay. If Barclay is now to be War and Peace  \n",
      "1486 of 2882 \n",
      "superseded by Bennigsen all will be lost, for Bennigsen \n",
      "showed his incapacity already in 1807.’ \n",
      "The sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on the \n",
      "contrary, that at any rate there was no one more active and \n",
      "experienced than Bennigsen: ‘and twist about as you may, \n",
      "you will have to come to Bennigsen eventually. Let the \n",
      "others make mistakes now!’ said they, arguing that our \n",
      "retirement to Drissa was a most shameful reverse and an \n",
      "unbroken series of blunders. ‘The more mistakes that are \n",
      "made the better. It will at any rate be unde rstood all the \n",
      "sooner that things cannot go on like this. What is wanted \n",
      "is not some Barclay or other, but a man like Bennigsen, \n",
      "who made his mark in 1807, and to whom Napoleon \n",
      "himself did justice- a man whose authority would be \n",
      "willingly recognized, and Bennigsen is the only such \n",
      "man.’ \n",
      "The seventh party consisted of  the sort of people who \n",
      "are always to be found, especially around young \n",
      "sovereigns, and of whom ther e were particularly many \n",
      "round Alexander- generals and imperial aides-de-camp \n",
      "passionately devoted to the Emperor, not merely as a \n",
      "monarch but as a man, a doring him sincerely and \n",
      "disinterestedly, as Rostov had done in 1805, and who saw \n",
      "in him not only all the virtue s but all human capabilities \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1487 of 2882 \n",
      "as well. These men, though enchanted with the sovereign \n",
      "for refusing the command of the army, yet blamed him for \n",
      "such excessive modesty, and only desired and insisted \n",
      "that their adored sovereign should abandon his diffidence \n",
      "and openly announce that he w ould place himself at the \n",
      "head of the army, gather round him a commander in \n",
      "chief’s staff, and, consulting experienced theoreticians \n",
      "and practical men where necessary, would himself lead \n",
      "the troops, whose spirits would thereby be raised to the \n",
      "highest pitch. \n",
      "The eighth and largest gr oup, which in its enormous \n",
      "numbers was to the others as ninety-nine to one, consisted \n",
      "of men who desired neither peace nor war, neither an \n",
      "advance nor a defensive camp at  the Drissa or anywhere \n",
      "else, neither Barclay nor the Emperor, neither Pfuel nor \n",
      "Bennigsen, but only the one most essential thing- as much \n",
      "advantage and pleasure for themselves as possible. In the \n",
      "troubled waters of conflicti ng and intersecting intrigues \n",
      "that eddied about the Emperor’s headquarters, it was \n",
      "possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at other \n",
      "times. A man who simply wished to retain his lucrative \n",
      "post would today agree with Pfuel, tomorrow with his \n",
      "opponent, and the day after, merely to avoid responsibility \n",
      "or to please the Emperor, w ould declare that he had no War and Peace  \n",
      "1488 of 2882 \n",
      "opinion at all on the matter. A nother who wished to gain \n",
      "some advantage would attract  the Emperor’s attention by \n",

      "maps which he spread on a ta ble, and put questions on \n",

      "1501 of 2882 \n",
      "a perfectly new position away from the Petersburg and \n",

      "expounded it not so much to answer the questions put- \n",
      "which, in fact, his plan did not  answer- as to avail himself \n",
      "of the opportunity to air it. It  was one of the millions of \n",
      "proposals, one as good as anothe r, that could be made as \n",
      "long as it was quite unknown what character the war \n",
      "would take. Some disputed his arguments, others \n",
      "defended them. Young Count Toll objected to the \n",
      "Swedish general’s views more warmly than anyone else, \n",
      "and in the course of the dis pute drew from his side pocket \n",
      "a well-filled notebook, which he  asked permission to read \n",
      "to them. In these voluminous notes Toll suggested another \n",
      "scheme, totally different from Armfeldt’s or Pfuel’s plan \n",

      "Pfuel only snorted contemptuous ly and turned away, to \n",
      "show that he would never de mean himself by replying to \n",
      "such nonsense as he was now hearing. So when Prince \n",
      "Volkonski, who was in the chair, called on him to give his \n",

      "you come to me! How mend ma tters? There is nothing to \n",
      "mend! The principles laid dow n by me must be strictly \n",
      "adhered to,’ said he, drumming on the table with his bony \n",
      "fingers. ‘What is the difficulty? Nonsense, childishness!’ \n",
      "He went up to the map and speaking rapidly began \n",
      "proving that no eventuality could alter the efficiency of \n",
      "the Drissa camp, that everything had been foreseen, and \n",
      "that if the enemy were really going to outflank it, the \n",
      "enemy would inevitably be destroyed. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1503 of 2882 \n",
      "Paulucci, who did not know German, began \n",

      "assistance of his chief, who spoke French badly, and \n",
      "began translating for him, hardly able to keep pace with \n",
      "Pfuel, who was rapidly dem onstrating that not only all \n",
      "that had happened, but all th at could happen, had been \n",
      "foreseen in his scheme, and that if there were now any \n",
      "difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan had \n",
      "not been precisely executed. He kept laughing \n",
      "sarcastically, he demonstrated, and at last contemptuously \n",
      "ceased to demonstrate, like a mathematician who ceases \n",
      "to prove in various ways th e accuracy of a problem that \n",

      "culminating in shouts and personalities, and the less was it \n",
      "possible to arrive at any gene ral conclusion from all that \n",
      "had been said. Prince Andrew, listening to this polyglot \n",
      "talk and to these surmises, plans, refutations, and shouts, \n",
      "felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying. A \n",
      "thought that had long since and often occurred to him \n",
      "during his military activities- the idea that there is not and \n",
      "cannot be any science of war, and that therefore there can \n",

      "1510 of 2882 \n",
      "It was, in fact, only the commencement of the \n",

      "Otradnoe with the hunting, a nd the winter with the \n",

      "beginning, and he had to remain with his regiment. And \n",
      "since it had to be so, Nicholas Rostov, as was natural to \n",
      "him, felt contented with the life he led in the regiment and \n",
      "was able to find pleasure in that life. \n",
      "On his return from his furlough Nicholas, having been \n",

      "remounts and brought back fr om the Ukraine excellent \n",

      "horses, and above all everybody was infected with the \n",
      "merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement \n",
      "of a war, and Rostov, consci ous of his advantageous \n",

      "pleasures and interests of military service, though he \n",
      "knew that sooner or later he  would have to relinquish \n",
      "them. \n",
      "The troops retired from Viln a for various complicated \n",
      "reasons of state, political and strategic. Each step of the \n",
      "retreat was accompanied by a complicated interplay of \n",
      "interests, arguments, and passions at headquarters. For the \n",
      "Pavlograd hussars, however, the whole of this retreat \n",
      "during the finest period of summer and with sufficient \n",
      "supplies was a very simple and agreeable business. \n",
      "It was only at headquarters that there was depression, \n",
      "uneasiness, and intriguing; in  the body of the army they \n",
      "did not ask themselves where they were going or why. If \n",
      "they regretted having to retr eat, it was only because they \n",
      "had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to, or \n",
      "some pretty young Polish lady. If the thought that things \n",

      "as cheerful as befits a good soldier and not to think of the \n",
      "general trend of affairs, but only of the task nearest to \n",
      "hand. First they camped gaily before Vilna, making War and Peace  \n",
      "1512 of 2882 \n",
      "acquaintance with the Polish landowners, preparing for \n",
      "reviews and being reviewed by the Emperor and other \n",
      "high commanders. Then came an order to retreat to \n",
      "Sventsyani and destroy any provisions they could not \n",
      "carry away with them. Sventsyani was remembered by the \n",
      "hussars only as the drunken camp, a name the whole army \n",
      "gave to their encampment there, and because many \n",
      "complaints were made agai nst the troops, who, taking \n",
      "advantage of the order to collect provisions, took also \n",
      "horses, carriages, and carpets from the Polish proprietors. \n",
      "Rostov remembered Sventsyani, because on the first day \n",

      "major and was unable to manage all the drunken men of \n",
      "his squadron who, unknown to hi m, had appropriated five \n",
      "barrels of old beer. From Sventsyani they retired farther \n",
      "and farther to Drissa, and thence again beyond Drissa, \n",
      "drawing near to the frontier of Russia proper. \n",
      "On the thirteenth of July the Pavlograds took part in a \n",
      "serious action for the first time. \n",
      "On the twelfth of July, on the eve of that action, there \n",
      "was a heavy storm of rain and hail. In general, the \n",
      "summer of 18l2 was remarkable for its storms. \n",
      "The two Pavlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a \n",
      "field of rye, which was already in ear but had been \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1513 of 2882 \n",
      "completely trodden down by cattle and horses. The rain \n",
      "was descending in torrents, and Rostov, with a young \n",
      "officer named Ilyin, his proteg e, was sitting in a hastily \n",
      "constructed shelter. An officer of their regiment, with \n",
      "long mustaches extending ont o his cheeks, who after \n",
      "riding to the staff had been overtaken by the rain, entered \n",
      "Rostov’s shelter. \n",
      "‘I have come from the staff, Count. Have you heard of \n",
      "Raevski’s exploit?’ \n",
      "And the officer gave them details of the Saltanov \n",
      "battle, which he had heard at the staff. \n",
      "Rostov, smoking his pipe and turning his head about as \n",
      "the water trickled down his n eck, listened inattentively, \n",
      "with an occasional glance at Ilyin, who was pressing close \n",
      "to him. This officer, a lad of sixteen who had recently \n",
      "joined the regiment, was now in the same relation to \n",
      "Nicholas that Nicholas had been to Denisov seven years \n",
      "before. Ilyin tried to imita te Rostov in everything and \n",
      "adored him as a girl might have done. \n",
      "Zdrzhinski, the officer with the long mustache, spoke \n",
      "grandiloquently of the Saltanov dam being ‘a Russian \n",
      "Thermopylae,’ and of how a deed worthy of antiquity had \n",
      "been performed by General Raevski. He recounted how \n",
      "Raevski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific War and Peace  \n",
      "1514 of 2882 \n",
      "fire and had charged with th em beside him. Rostov heard \n",
      "the story and not only said nothing to encourage \n",
      "Zdrzhinski’s enthusiasm but, on the contrar y, looked like \n",
      "a man ashamed of what he was hearing, though with no \n",
      "intention of contradicting it. Since the campaigns of \n",
      "Austerlitz and of 1807 Rost ov knew by experience that \n",
      "men always lie when describing military exploits, as he \n",
      "himself had done when recounting them; besides that, he \n",
      "had experience enough to know that nothing happens in \n",
      "war at all as we can imagine or relate it. And so he did not \n",
      "like Zdrzhinski’s tale, nor did he like Zdrzhinski himself \n",
      "who, with his mustaches extending over his cheeks, bent \n",
      "low over the face of his hearer, as was his habit, and \n",
      "crowded Rostov in the narro w shanty. Rostov looked at \n",
      "him in silence. ‘In the first place, there must have been \n",
      "such a confusion and crowding on the dam that was being \n",
      "attacked that if Raevski did lead his sons there, it could \n",
      "have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen men \n",
      "nearest to him,’ thought he, ‘the rest could not have seen \n",
      "how or with whom Raevski came onto the dam. And even \n",
      "those who did see it would not have been much stimulated \n",
      "by it, for what had they to do with Raevski’s tender \n",
      "paternal feelings when thei r own skins were in danger? \n",
      "And besides, the fate of the Fatherland did not depend on \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1515 of 2882 \n",
      "whether they took the Saltanov dam or not, as we are told \n",
      "was the case at Thermopylae. So why should he have \n",
      "made such a sacrifice? A nd why expose his own children \n",
      "in the battle? I would not have taken my brother Petya \n",
      "there, or even Ilyin, who’s a stranger to me but a nice lad, \n",
      "but would have tried to put them somewhere under \n",
      "cover,’ Nicholas continued to  think, as he listened to \n",
      "Zdrzhinski. But he did not express his thoughts, for in \n",
      "such matters, too, he had gained experience. He knew that \n",
      "this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one \n",
      "had to pretend not to doubt it. And he acted accordingly. \n",
      "‘I can’t stand this any more,’ said Ilyin, noticing that \n",
      "Rostov did not relish Zdrz hinski’s conversation. ‘My \n",
      "stockings and shirt... and the water is running on my seat! \n",
      "I’ll go and look for shelter. The rain seems less heavy.’ \n",
      "Ilyin went out and Zdrzhinski rode away. \n",
      "Five minutes later Ilyin, splashing through the mud, \n",
      "came running back to the shanty. \n",
      "‘Hurrah! Rostov, come quick! I’ve found it! About two \n",
      "hundred yards away there’s a tavern where ours have \n",
      "already gathered. We can at least get dry there, and Mary \n",
      "Hendrikhovna’s there.’ \n",
      "Mary Hendrikhovna was the wife of the regimental \n",

      "1516 of 2882 \n",
      "Poland. The doctor, whether from lack of means or \n",
      "because he did not like to pa rt from his young wife in the \n",
      "early days of their marriage,  took her about with him \n",
      "wherever the hussar regiment went and his jealousy had \n",
      "become a standing joke among the hussar officers. \n",
      "Rostov threw his cloak over his shoulders, shouted to \n",
      "Lavrushka to follow with the things, and- now slipping in \n",
      "the mud, now splashing right th rough it- set off with Ilyin \n",
      "in the lessening rain a nd the darkness that was \n",
      "occasionally rent by distant lightning. \n",

      "dressing jacket and nightcap, was sitting on a broad bench \n",
      "in the front corner. Her hus band, the doctor, lay asleep \n",
      "behind her. Rostov and Ilyin, on entering the room, were \n",
      "welcomed with merry shouts and laughter. \n",
      "‘Dear me, how jolly we are!’ said Rostov laughing. \n",
      "‘And why do you stand there gaping?’ \n",

      "recess behind a partition to change, but found it \n",
      "completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards \n",
      "by the light of a solitary candle on an empty box, and \n",
      "these officers would on no account yield their position. \n",
      "Mary Hendrikhovna obliged th em with the loan of a War and Peace  \n",

      "Rostov and Ilyin, helped by Lavrushka who had brought \n",
      "their kits, changed their wet things for dry ones. \n",
      "A fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove. A \n",
      "board was found, fixed on two saddles and covered with a \n",
      "horsecloth, a small samovar was produced and a cellaret \n",
      "and half a bottle of rum, and having asked Mary \n",
      "Hendrikhovna to preside, they all crowded round her. One \n",
      "offered her a clean handkerchief to wipe her charming \n",
      "hands, another spread a jacket under her little feet to keep \n",
      "them from the damp, anot her hung his coat over the \n",
      "window to keep out the draft,  and yet another waved the \n",
      "flies off her husband’s face, lest he should wake up. \n",
      "‘Leave him alone,’ said Mary Hendrikhovna, smiling \n",
      "timidly and happily. ‘He is sl eeping well as it is, after a \n",
      "sleepless night.’ \n",
      "‘Oh, no, Mary Hendrikhovna,’ replied the officer, ‘one \n",

      "There were only three tumblers, the water was so \n",

      "playing cards behind the partition soon left their game and \n",
      "came over to the samovar, yielding to the general mood of \n",
      "courting Mary Hendrikhovna. She, seeing herself \n",
      "surrounded by such brilliant  and polite young men, \n",
      "beamed with satisfaction, try as she might to hide it, and \n",
      "perturbed as she evidently was each time her husband \n",

      "There was only one spoon, sugar was more plentiful \n",
      "than anything else, but it took too long to dissolve, so it \n",

      "His face was sad and depressed. Without greeting the \n",

      "ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place \n",
      "in the covered trap. Severa l times Rostov, covering his \n",
      "head, tried to go to sleep, but some remark would arouse \n",

      "talking, the officers began hur riedly getting ready and \n",
      "again boiled again boiled some muddy water in the \n",
      "samovar. But Rostov went off to his squadron without \n",
      "waiting for tea. Day was breaking, the rain had ceased, \n",
      "and the clouds were dispersing. It felt damp and cold, \n",
      "especially in clothes that were still moist. As they left the \n",
      "tavern in the twilight of the dawn, Rostov and Ilyin both \n",
      "glanced under the wet and glis tening leather hood of the \n",
      "doctor’s cart, from under the apron of which his feet were \n",
      "sticking out, and in the middle of which his wife’s \n",

      "a boy of sixteen. \n",
      "Half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the \n",
      "road. The command was heard to ‘mount’ and the soldiers \n",
      "crossed themselves and mounted. Rostov riding in front War and Peace  \n",
      "1524 of 2882 \n",
      "gave the order ‘Forward!’ and the hussars, with clanking \n",
      "sabers and subdued talk, thei r horses’ hoofs splashing in \n",
      "the mud, defiled in fours and moved along the broad road \n",

      "infantry and a battery that had gone on in front. \n",
      "Tattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, \n",
      "were scudding before the wind. It was growing lighter and \n",
      "lighter. That curly grass wh ich always grows by country \n",
      "roadsides became clearly visible, still wet with the night’s \n",
      "rain; the drooping branches of  the birches, also wet, \n",
      "swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water \n",
      "to one side. The soldiers’ faces were more and more \n",
      "clearly visible. Rostov, always  closely followed by Ilyin, \n",
      "rode along the side of the ro ad between two rows of birch \n",
      "trees. \n",
      "When campaigning, Rostov allowed himself the \n",
      "indulgence of riding not a regimental but a Cossack horse. \n",
      "A judge of horses and a sportsman, he had lately procured \n",
      "himself a large, fine, mettlesome, Donets horse, dun-\n",
      "colored, with light mane and tail, and when he rode it no \n",
      "one could outgallop him. To ride this horse was a pleasure \n",
      "to him, and he thought of the horse, of the morning, of the \n",
      "doctor’s wife, but not once of the impending danger. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1525 of 2882 \n",
      "Formerly, when going into action, Rostov had felt \n",
      "afraid; now he had not the le ast feeling of fear. He was \n",
      "fearless, not because he had grown used to being under \n",
      "fire (one cannot grow used to danger), but because he had \n",
      "learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger. He \n",
      "had grown accustomed when going into action to think \n",
      "about anything but what w ould seem most likely to \n",
      "interest him- the impending danger. During the first \n",
      "period of his service, hard as  he tried and much as he \n",
      "reproached himself with coward ice, he had not been able \n",
      "to do this, but with time it had come of itself. Now he \n",
      "rode beside Ilyin under the birch trees, occasionally \n",
      "plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand, \n",
      "sometimes touching his horse’s  side with his foot, or, \n",
      "without turning round, handing a pipe he had finished to \n",
      "an hussar riding behind him, w ith as calm and careless an \n",
      "air as though he were merely  out for a ride. He glanced \n",
      "with pity at the excited face of Ilyin, who talked much and \n",
      "in great agitation. He knew from experience the \n",
      "tormenting expectation of terro r and death the cornet was \n",
      "suffering and knew that only time could help him. \n",
      "As soon as the sun appeared  in a clear strip of sky \n",
      "beneath the clouds, the wind fell,  as if it dared not spoil \n",
      "the beauty of the summer morning after the storm; drops War and Peace  \n",
      "1526 of 2882 \n",
      "still continued to fall, but ve rtically now, and all was still. \n",
      "The whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared \n",
      "behind a long narrow cloud th at hung above it. A few \n",
      "minutes later it reappeared br ighter still from behind the \n",
      "top of the cloud, tearing its e dge. Everything grew bright \n",
      "and glittered. And with that light, and as if in reply to it, \n",
      "came the sound of guns ahead of them. \n",
      "Before Rostov had had time to consider and determine \n",
      "the distance of that firing, Count Ostermann-Tolstoy’s \n",
      "adjutant came galloping from  Vitebsk with orders to \n",
      "advance at a trot along the road. \n",
      "The squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the \n",
      "battery- which had also quickened their pace- rode down \n",
      "a hill, and passing through an empty and deserted village \n",
      "again ascended. The horses began to lather and the men to \n",
      "flush. \n",
      "‘Halt! Dress your ranks!’ the order of the regimental \n",
      "commander was heard ahead. ‘Forward by the left. Walk, \n",
      "march!’ came the order from in front. \n",
      "And the hussars, passing along the line of troops on the \n",
      "left flank of our position, ha lted behind our Uhlans who \n",
      "were in the front line. To th e right stood our infantry in a \n",
      "dense column: they were the reserve. Higher up the hill, \n",
      "on the very horizon, our guns were visible through the \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1527 of 2882 \n",
      "wonderfully clear air, bri ghtly illuminated by slanting \n",
      "morning sunbeams. In front, beyond a hollow dale, could \n",
      "be seen the enemy’s columns and guns. Our advanced \n",
      "line, already in action, could be heard briskly exchanging \n",
      "shots with the enemy in the dale. \n",
      "At these sounds, long unheard, Rostov’s spirits rose, as \n",
      "at the strains of the merri est music. Trap-ta-ta-tap! \n",
      "cracked the shots, now togeth er, now several quickly one \n",
      "after another. Again all was silent and then again it \n",
      "sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and \n",
      "exploding them. \n",
      "The hussars remained in the same place for about an \n",
      "hour. A cannonade began. Count Ostermann with his suite \n",
      "rode up behind the squadron, halted, spoke to the \n",
      "commander of the regiment, and rode up the hill to the \n",
      "guns. \n",
      "After Ostermann had gone, a command rang out to the \n",
      "Uhlans. \n",
      "‘Form column! Prepare to charge!’ \n",
      "The infantry in front of them parted into platoons to \n",
      "allow the cavalry to pass. The Uhlans started, the \n",
      "streamers on their spears fl uttering, and trotted downhill \n",
      "toward the French cavalry which was seen below to the \n",
      "left. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1528 of 2882 \n",
      "As soon as the Uhlans des cended the hill, the hussars \n",
      "were ordered up the hill to support the battery. As they \n",
      "took the places vacated by the Uhlans, bullets came from \n",
      "the front, whining and whistli ng, but fell spent without \n",
      "taking effect. \n",
      "The sounds, which he had not heard for so long, had an \n",
      "even more pleasurable and e xhilarating effect on Rostov \n",
      "than the previous sounds of firing. Drawing himself up, \n",
      "he viewed the field of battle  opening out before him from \n",
      "the hill, and with his whole soul followed the movement \n",
      "of the Uhlans. They swooped down close to the French \n",
      "dragoons, something confused happened there amid the \n",
      "smoke, and five minutes later our Uhlans were galloping \n",
      "back, not to the place they ha d occupied but more to the \n",
      "left, and among the orange-colored Uhlans on chestnut \n",
      "horses and behind them, in a large group, blue French \n",

      "Chapter XV \n",
      "Rostov, with his keen sportsman’s eye, was one of the \n",
      "first to catch sight of these blue French dragoons pursuing \n",
      "our Uhlans. Nearer and nearer in disorderly crowds came \n",
      "the Uhlans and the French dragoons pursuing them. He \n",
      "could already see how these men, who looked so small at \n",
      "the foot of the hill, jostle d and overtook one another, \n",
      "waving their arms and their sabers in the air. \n",
      "Rostov gazed at what was happening before him as at a \n",
      "hunt. He felt instinctively that if the hussars struck at the \n",
      "French dragoons now, the latter could not withstand them, \n",
      "but if a charge was to be made it must be done now, at \n",
      "that very moment, or it w ould be too late. He looked \n",
      "around. A captain, standing besi de him, was gazing like \n",
      "himself with eyes fixed on the cavalry below them. \n",
      "‘Andrew Sevastyanych!’ said Rostov. ‘You know, we \n",
      "could crush them...’ \n",
      "‘A fine thing too!’ replied the captain, ‘and really..’ \n",
      "Rostov, without waiting to hear him out, touched his \n",
      "horse, galloped to the front of his squadron, and before he \n",
      "had time to finish giving the word of command, the whole \n",
      "squadron, sharing his feeling,  was following him. Rostov War and Peace  \n",
      "1530 of 2882 \n",
      "himself did not know how or why he did it. He acted as he \n",
      "did when hunting, without re flecting or considering. He \n",
      "saw the dragoons near and th at they were galloping in \n",
      "disorder; he knew they coul d not withstand an attack- \n",
      "knew there was only that moment and that if he let it slip \n",
      "it would not return. The bullets were whining and \n",
      "whistling so stimulatingly around him and his horse was \n",
      "so eager to go that he could not restrain himself. He \n",
      "touched his horse, gave the word of command, and \n",
      "immediately, hearing behind hi m the tramp of the horses \n",
      "of his deployed squadron, r ode at full trot downhill \n",
      "toward the dragoons. Hardly had they reached the bottom \n",
      "of the hill before their pace instinctively changed to a \n",
      "gallop, which grew faster and fa ster as they drew nearer \n",
      "to our Uhlans and the French dragoons who galloped after \n",
      "them. The dragoons were now close at hand. On seeing \n",
      "the hussars, the foremost began to turn, while those \n",
      "behind began to halt. With the same feeling with which he \n",
      "had galloped across the path of  a wolf, Rostov gave rein \n",
      "to his Donets horse and gallope d to intersect the path of \n",
      "the dragoons’ disordered lines. One Uhlan stopped, \n",
      "another who was on foot flung himself to the ground to \n",
      "avoid being knocked over, and a riderless horse fell in \n",
      "among the hussars. Nearly al l the French dragoons were \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1531 of 2882 \n",
      "galloping back. Rostov, pickin g out one on a gray horse, \n",
      "dashed after him. On the way he came upon a bush, his \n",
      "gallant horse cleared it, and al most before he had righted \n",
      "himself in his saddle he sa w that he would immediately \n",
      "overtake the enemy he had selected. That Frenchman, by \n",
      "his uniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching \n",
      "on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber. In \n",
      "another moment Rostov’s horse dashed its breast against \n",
      "the hindquarters of the officer’s horse, almost knocking it \n",
      "over, and at the same instant Rostov, without knowing \n",
      "why, raised his saber and struck the Frenchman with it. \n",
      "The instant he had done th is, all Rostov’s animation \n",
      "vanished. The officer fell, not so much from the blow- \n",
      "which had but slightly cut his arm above the elbow- as \n",
      "from the shock to his horse and from fright. Rostov reined \n",
      "in his horse, and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he \n",
      "had vanquished. The French dragoon officer was hopping \n",
      "with one foot on the ground, the other being caught in the \n",
      "stirrup. His eyes, screwed up with fear as if he every \n",
      "moment expected another blow, gazed up at Rostov with \n",
      "shrinking terror. His pale and mud-stained face- fair and \n",
      "young, with a dimple in the ch in and light-blue eyes- was \n",
      "not an enemy’s face at all su ited to a battlefield, but a \n",
      "most ordinary, homelike face. Before Rostov had decided War and Peace  \n",
      "1532 of 2882 \n",
      "what to do with him, the o fficer cried, ‘I surrender!’ He \n",
      "hurriedly but vainly tried to ge t his foot out of the stirrup \n",
      "and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from \n",
      "Rostov’s face. Some hussars who galloped up disengaged \n",
      "his foot and helped him into the saddle. On all sides, the \n",
      "hussars were busy with the dragoons; one was wounded, \n",
      "but though his face was bleeding, he would not give up \n",
      "his horse; another was perche d up behind an hussar with \n",
      "his arms round him; a third was being helped by an hussar \n",
      "to mount his horse. In front, the French infantry were \n",
      "firing as they ran. The hussars galloped hastily back with \n",
      "their prisoners. Rostov galloped back with the rest, aware \n",
      "of an unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart. \n",
      "Something vague and confused, which he could not at all \n",
      "account for, had come over him with the capture of that \n",
      "officer and the blow he had dealt him. \n",
      "Count Ostermann-Tolstoy met the returning hussars, \n",
      "sent for Rostov, thanked him, and said he would report his \n",
      "gallant deed to the Emperor and would recommend him \n",
      "for a St. George’s Cross. When sent for by Count \n",
      "Ostermann, Rostov, remember ing that he had charged \n",
      "without orders, felt sure his commander was sending for \n",
      "him to punish him for breach of discipline. Ostermann’s \n",
      "flattering words and promise of a reward should therefore \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1533 of 2882 \n",
      "have struck him all the more pleasantly, but he still felt \n",
      "that same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea. \n",
      "‘But what on earth is worrying me?’ he asked himself as \n",
      "he rode back from the general. ‘Ilyin? No, he’s safe. Have \n",

      "Something else, resembling remorse, tormented him. \n",
      "‘Yes, oh yes, that French officer with the dimple. And I \n",
      "remember how my arm paused when I raised it.’ \n",
      "Rostov saw the prisoners be ing led away and galloped \n",
      "after them to have a look at his Frenchman with the \n",
      "dimple on his chin. He was sitting in his foreign uniform \n",
      "on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about him; \n",
      "The sword cut on his arm c ould scarcely be called a \n",
      "wound. He glanced at Rostov with a feigned smile and \n",
      "waved his hand in greeting. Ro stov still had the same \n",
      "indefinite feeling, as of shame. \n",
      "All that day and the next his friends and comrades \n",
      "noticed that Rostov, without being dull or angry, was \n",
      "silent, thoughtful, and preocc upied. He drank reluctantly, \n",
      "tried to remain alone, and ke pt turning something over in \n",
      "his mind. \n",
      "Rostov was always thinking a bout that brilliant exploit \n",
      "of his, which to his amazement had gained him the St. \n",
      "George’s Cross and even given him a reputation for War and Peace  \n",
      "1534 of 2882 \n",
      "bravery, and there was someth ing he could not at all \n",
      "understand. ‘So others are even more afraid than I am!’ he \n",
      "thought. ‘So that’s all there is in what is called heroism! \n",
      "And heroism! And did I do it for my country’s sake? And \n",
      "how was he to blame, with his dimple and blue eyes? And \n",
      "how frightened he was! He t hought that I should kill him. \n",
      "Why should I kill him? My hand trembled. And they have \n",

      "But while Nicholas was c onsidering thes e questions \n",
      "and still could reach no clear solution of what puzzled \n",
      "him so, the wheel of fortune in the service, as often \n",

      "From the day when Pierre, after leaving the Rostovs’ \n",
      "with Natasha’s grateful look fresh in his mind, had gazed \n",
      "at the comet that seemed to be fixed in the sky and felt \n",
      "that something new was appearing on his own horizon- \n",

      "all earthly things, that had incessantly tormented him, no \n",
      "longer presented itself. That  terrible question ‘Why?’ \n",
      "‘Wherefore?’ which had come to him amid every \n",
      "occupation, was now replaced, not by another question or \n",
      "by a reply to the former question, but by her image. When \n",
      "he listened to, or himself took part in, trivial \n",
      "conversations, when he read or heard of human baseness \n",
      "or folly, he was not horrified as formerly, and did not ask \n",
      "himself why men struggled so about these things when all \n",
      "is so transient and incompre hensible- but he remembered \n",
      "her as he had last seen her, and all his doubts vanished- \n",
      "not because she had answered  the questions that had \n",
      "haunted him, but because  his conception of her \n",
      "transferred him instantly to a nother, a brighter, realm of \n",
      "spiritual activity in which no one could be justified or \n",
      "guilty- a realm of beauty and love which it was worth \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1559 of 2882 \n",
      "living for. Whatever worldly baseness presented itself to \n",

      "‘Well, supposing N. N. swindled the country and the \n",
      "Tsar, and the country and the Tsar confer honors upon \n",
      "him, what does that matter? She smiled at me yesterday \n",

      "will ever know it.’ And his soul felt calm and peaceful. \n",
      "Pierre still went into society, drank as much and led the \n",
      "same idle and dissipated life, because besides the hours he \n",
      "spent at the Rostovs’ there were other hours he had to \n",
      "spend somehow, and the habits and acquaintances he had \n",
      "made in Moscow formed a current that bore him along \n",
      "irresistibly. But latterly, when more and more disquieting \n",

      "former feeling of careful pity, an ever-increasing \n",

      "would change his whole life,  and he impatiently sought \n",
      "everywhere for signs of that approaching catastrophe. One \n",

      "‘Count, is it wrong of me to sing?’ she said blushing, \n",

      "think? What do you think?’ \n",
      "‘I think...’ Pierre replied, ‘that he has nothing to \n",

      "By association of ideas, Pierre was at once carried \n",

      "dressing and arranging his ha ir and collar to look like a \n",
      "grown-up man. He frowned be fore his looking glass, \n",
      "gesticulated, shrugged his s houlders, and finally, without \n",
      "saying a word to anyone, took his cap and left the house \n",
      "by the back door, trying to avoi d notice. Petya decided to \n",

      "patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite \n",
      "of all his determination he had to give in, and stop while \n",
      "carriages passed in, rumbling beneath the archway. \n",
      "Beside Petya stood a peasant woman, a footman, two \n",

      "‘What are you shoving for, young lordling? Don’t you \n",

      "1579 of 2882 \n",
      "For a while the crowd was less dense, but suddenly all \n",

      "scarcely breathe, and everybody shouted, ‘Hurrah! \n",
      "hurrah! hurrah!’ Petya stood on tiptoe and pushed and \n",
      "pinched, but could see nothing except the people about \n",
      "him. \n",
      "All the faces bore the same expression of excitement \n",

      "out on it; but just then the crowd swayed back- the police \n",
      "in front were pushing back those who had pressed too \n",
      "close to the procession: the Emperor was passing from the \n",
      "palace to the Cathedral of the Assumption- and Petya \n",
      "unexpectedly received such a blow on his side and ribs \n",
      "and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew \n",

      "and after them others in a more leisurely manner: caps \n",
      "were again raised, and those who had run to look at the \n",

      "then to the ground. A coachma n in a jerkin, who stood \n",
      "nearest, sprang forward and snatched it up. Several people \n",
      "in the crowd rushed at the coachman. Seeing this the \n",
      "Emperor had a plateful of bi scuits brought him and began \n",

      "Two days later, on the fifteenth of July, an immense \n",
      "number of carriages were standing outside the Sloboda \n",

      "The great halls were full. In the first were the nobility \n",

      "All these nobles, whom Pierre met every day at the \n",

      "others again in the new unifo rms of Alexander’s time or \n",
      "the ordinary uniform of the nobility, and the general \n",
      "characteristic of being in uniform imparted something \n",
      "strange and fantastic to these diverse and familiar \n",
      "personalities, both old and young. The old men, dim-eyed, \n",
      "toothless, bald, sallow, and bloated, or gaunt and \n",
      "wrinkled, were especially stri king. For the most part they \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1587 of 2882 \n",
      "sat quietly in their places and were silent, or, if they \n",
      "walked about and talked, attached themselves to someone \n",
      "younger. On all these faces, as on the faces of the crowd \n",
      "Petya had seen in the S quare, there was a striking \n",
      "contradiction: the general expe ctation of a solemn event, \n",
      "and at the same time the everyday interests in a boston \n",
      "card party, Peter the cook, Zinaida Dmitrievna’s health, \n",
      "and so on. \n",
      "Pierre was there too, buttone d up since early morning \n",
      "in a nobleman’s uniform that had become too tight for \n",
      "him. He was agitated; this extraordinary gathering not \n",
      "only of nobles but also of th e merchant-class- les etats \n",
      "generaux (States-General)- e voked in him a whole series \n",
      "of ideas he had long laid as ide but which were deeply \n",
      "graven in his soul: thoughts of  the Contrat social and the \n",
      "French Revolution. The words that had struck him in the \n",
      "Emperor’s appeal- that the sovereign was coming to the \n",
      "capital for consultation with his people- strengthened this \n",
      "idea. And imagining that in  this direction something \n",

      "he strolled about watching a nd listening to conversations, \n",

      "1588 of 2882 \n",

      "stand when the Emperor ente red, when a ball should be \n",
      "given in the Emperor’s honor, whether they should group \n",
      "themselves by districts or by whole provinces... and so on; \n",
      "but as soon as the war was touched on, or what the \n",
      "nobility had been convened for, the talk became \n",
      "undecided and indefinite. Then all preferred listening to \n",
      "speaking. \n",
      "A middle-aged man, handsom e and virile, in the \n",
      "uniform of a retired naval officer, was speaking in one of \n",
      "the rooms, and a small cr owd was pressing round him. \n",
      "Pierre went up to the circle that had formed round the \n",
      "speaker and listened. Count Ilya Rostov, in a military \n",
      "uniform of Catherine’s time, was sauntering with a \n",
      "pleasant smile among the crowd, with all of whom he was \n",
      "acquainted. He too approached  that group and listened \n",
      "with a kindly smile and nods of  approval, as he always \n",
      "did, to what the speaker was saying. The retired naval \n",
      "man was speaking very boldly,  as was evident from the \n",
      "expression on the faces of the listeners and from the fact \n",
      "that some people Pierre knew as the meekest and quietest \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1589 of 2882 \n",
      "of men walked away disa pprovingly or expressed \n",
      "disagreement with him. Pierre pushed his way into the \n",
      "middle of the group, listened, and convinced himself that \n",
      "the man was indeed a liberal, but of views quite different \n",
      "from his own. The naval officer spoke in a particularly \n",
      "sonorous, musical, and aristo cratic baritone voice, \n",
      "pleasantly swallowing his r’s and generally slurring his \n",
      "consonants: the voice of a man calling out to his servant, \n",
      "‘Heah! Bwing me my pipe!’ It was indicative of \n",
      "dissipation and the exercise of authority. \n",
      "‘What if the Smolensk people have offahd to waise \n",

      "with animation. \n",
      "Count Rostov’s mouth watered with pleasure and he \n",
      "nudged Pierre, but Pierre wanted to speak himself. He \n",
      "pushed forward, feeling stirre d, but not yet sure what \n",
      "stirred him or what he would say. Scarcely had he opened \n",
      "his mouth when one of the senators, a man without a tooth \n",
      "in his head, with a shrewd  though angry expression, \n",
      "standing near the first speaker , interrupted him. Evidently \n",
      "accustomed to managing debates and to maintaining an \n",
      "argument, he began in low but distinct tones: \n",
      "‘I imagine, sir,’ said he, mumbling with his toothless \n",
      "mouth, ‘that we have been summoned here not to discuss \n",
      "whether it’s best for the empire  at the present moment to \n",
      "adopt conscription or to call out the militia. We have been \n",
      "summoned to reply to the appeal with which our \n",
      "sovereign the Emperor has honor ed us. But to judge what \n",
      "is best- conscription or the militia- we can leave to the \n",
      "supreme authority...’ \n",
      "Pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement. He \n",
      "hardened his heart against the senator who was \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1591 of 2882 \n",
      "introducing this set and narrow attitude into the \n",
      "deliberations of the nobility. Pierre stepped forward and \n",
      "interrupted him. He himsel f did not yet know what he \n",
      "would say, but he began to speak eagerly, occasionally \n",
      "lapsing into French or e xpressing himself in bookish \n",
      "Russian. \n",
      "‘Excuse me, your excellency,’ he began. (He was well \n",
      "acquainted with the senator,  but thought it necessary on \n",
      "this occasion to address him formally.) ‘Though I don’t \n",
      "agree with the gentleman...’ (h e hesitated: he wished to \n",
      "say, ‘Mon tres honorable  preopinant’- ‘My very \n",
      "honorable opponent’) ‘with the gentleman... whom I have \n",
      "not the honor of knowing, I suppos e that the nobility have \n",
      "been summoned not merely to express their sympathy and \n",
      "enthusiasm but also to cons ider the means by which we \n",
      "can assist our Fatherland!  I imagine,’ he went on, \n",
      "warming to his subject, ‘that the Emperor himself would \n",
      "not be satisfied to find in us merely owners of serfs whom \n",
      "we are willing to devote to his service, and chair a canon* \n",
      "we are ready to make of ourselves- and not to obtain from \n",
      "us any co-co-counsel.’ \n",

      "senator’s sarcastic smile and the freedom of Pierre’s War and Peace  \n",
      "1592 of 2882 \n",
      "remarks. Only Count Rostov wa s pleased with them as he \n",
      "had been pleased with those of the naval officer, the \n",
      "senator, and in general with whatever speech he had last \n",
      "heard. \n",
      "‘I think that before discussi ng these questions,’ Pierre \n",
      "continued, ‘we should ask the Emperor- most respectfully \n",

      "and the position in which our army and our forces now \n",
      "are, and then..’ \n",
      "But scarcely had Pierre utte red these words before he \n",
      "was attacked from three sides. The most vigorous attack \n",
      "came from an old acquaintance, a boston player who had \n",
      "always been well disposed toward him, Stepan \n",
      "Stepanovich Adraksin. Adraksin was in uniform, and \n",
      "whether as a result of the uniform or from some other \n",
      "cause Pierre saw before him quite a different man. With a \n",
      "sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face, \n",
      "Adraksin shouted at Pierre: \n",
      "‘In the first place, I tell you we have no right to \n",
      "question the Emperor about that, and secondly, if the \n",
      "Russian nobility had that right, the Emperor could not \n",
      "answer such a question. The troops are moved according \n",

      "1593 of 2882 \n",
      "Another voice, that of a nobl eman of medium height \n",
      "and about forty years of age, whom Pierre had formerly \n",
      "met at the gypsies’ and knew as a bad cardplayer, and \n",
      "who, also transformed by his uniform, came up to Pierre, \n",
      "interrupted Adraksin. \n",
      "‘Yes, and this is not a ti me for discussing,’ he \n",

      "enemy is advancing to destroy Russia, to desecrate the \n",
      "tombs of our fathers, to carry  off our wives and children.’ \n",
      "The nobleman smote his breast. ‘We will all arise, every \n",
      "one of us will go, for our father the Tsar!’ he shouted, \n",
      "rolling his bloodshot eyes. Several approving voices were \n",
      "heard in the crowd. ‘We are Russians and will not grudge \n",
      "our blood in defense of our faith, the throne, and the \n",
      "Fatherland! We must cease raving if we are sons of our \n",
      "Fatherland! We will show Europe how Russia rises to the \n",
      "defense of Russia!’ \n",
      "Pierre wished to reply, but could not get in a word. He \n",
      "felt that his words, apart from what meaning they \n",
      "conveyed, were less audible than the sound of his \n",
      "opponent’s voice. \n",
      "Count Rostov at the back of the crowd was expressing \n",
      "approval; several persons, br iskly turning a shoulder to \n",

      "1594 of 2882 \n",
      "‘That’s right, quite right! Just so!’ \n",

      "state of affairs in order to be able to improve it, but he \n",
      "was unable to speak. Many voice s shouted and talked at \n",
      "the same time, so that Count Rostov had not time to \n",
      "signify his approval of them all, and the group increased, \n",
      "dispersed, re-formed, and then moved with a hum of talk \n",
      "into the largest hall and to  the big table. Not only was \n",
      "Pierre’s attempt to speak unsuccessful, but he was rudely \n",
      "interrupted, pushed aside, and people turned away from \n",
      "him as from a common enemy. This happened not \n",
      "because they were displeased by the substance of his \n",
      "speech, which had even been forgotten after the many \n",
      "subsequent speeches, but to animate it the crowd needed a \n",
      "tangible object to love and a tangible object to hate. Pierre \n",
      "became the latter. Many othe r orators spoke after the \n",
      "excited nobleman, and all in the same tone. Many spoke \n",
      "eloquently and with originality. \n",
      "Glinka, the editor of the Russian Messenger, who was \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1623 of 2882 \n",
      "probably because of the oppr essive thoughts he had had \n",
      "when lying there. It was uns atisfactory everywhere, but \n",
      "the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better \n",

      "‘Women, women! Women’s fuss!’ muttered Alpatych \n",
      "to himself and started on his journey, looking round at the \n",
      "fields of yellow rye and th e still-green, thickly growing \n",
      "oats, and at other qui te black fields just being plowed a \n",

      "which here and there were already being reaped, made his \n",

      "himself whether he had not fo rgotten any of the prince’s \n",

      "and troops on the road. As he approached Smolensk he \n",
      "heard the sounds of distant firing, but these did not \n",
      "impress him. What struck hi m most was the sight of a \n",
      "splendid field of oats in wh ich a camp had been pitched \n",
      "and which was being mown down by the soldiers, \n",
      "evidently for fodder. This fact  impressed Alpatych, but in \n",
      "thinking about his own business he soon forgot it. \n",
      "All the interests of his life for more than thirty years \n",
      "had been bounded by the will of the prince, and he never \n",
      "went beyond that limit. Everything not connected with the \n",

      "1629 of 2882 \n",

      "Dnieper, at the inn kept by Ferapontov, where he had \n",
      "been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years. \n",
      "Some thirty years ago Fera pontov, by Alpatych’s advice, \n",
      "had bought a wood from the prin ce, had begun to trade, \n",
      "and now had a house, an inn, and a corn dealer’s shop in \n",
      "that province. He was a stout, dark, red-faced peasant in \n",
      "the forties, with thick lips, a broad knob of a nose, similar \n",
      "knobs over his black frowning brows, and a round belly. \n",
      "Wearing a waistcoat over hi s cotton shirt, Ferapontov \n",
      "was standing before his shop which opened onto the \n",

      "‘You’re welcome, Yakov Alpatych. Folks are leaving \n",
      "the town, but you have come to it,’ said he. \n",
      "‘Why are they leaving the town?’ asked Alpatych. \n",
      "‘That’s what I say. Folks are foolish! Always afraid of \n",
      "the French.’ \n",
      "‘Women’s fuss, women’s fuss!’ said Alpatych. \n",
      "‘Just what I think, Yakov Alpatych. What I say is: \n",
      "orders have been given not to let them in, so that must be War and Peace  \n",
      "1630 of 2882 \n",
      "right. And the peasants are asking three rubles for carting- \n",
      "it isn’t Christian!’ \n",
      "Yakov Alpatych heard without heeding. He asked for a \n",
      "samovar and for hay for his horses, and when he had had \n",
      "his tea he went to bed. \n",
      "All night long troops were m oving past the inn. Next \n",
      "morning Alpatych donned a jacket he wore only in town \n",
      "and went out on business. It was a sunny morning and by \n",
      "eight o’clock it was al ready hot. ‘A good day for \n",
      "harvesting,’ thought Alpatych. \n",
      "From beyond the town firing had been heard since \n",
      "early morning. At eight o’ clock the booming of cannon \n",
      "was added to the sound of musketry. Many people were \n",
      "hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers, \n",
      "but cabs were still driving about, tradesmen stood at their \n",
      "shops, and service was being held in the churches as \n",
      "usual. Alpatych went to the shops, to government offices, \n",
      "to the post office, and to th e Governor’s. In the offices \n",
      "and shops and at the post office everyone was talking \n",
      "about the army and about the enemy who was already \n",
      "attacking the town, everybody was asking what should be \n",
      "done, and all were trying to calm one another. \n",
      "In front of the Governor’s house Alpatych found a \n",
      "large number of people, Cossacks, and a traveling \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1631 of 2882 \n",
      "carriage of the Governor’s. At the porch he met two of the \n",
      "landed gentry, one of whom he knew. This man, an ex-\n",
      "captain of police, was saying angrily: \n",
      "‘It’s no joke, you know! It’s all very well if you’re \n",
      "single. ‘One man though undone  is but one,’ as the \n",
      "proverb says, but with thirteen in your family and all the \n",
      "property... They’ve brought us to utter ruin! What sort of \n",
      "governors are they to do that? They ought to be hanged- \n",
      "the brigands!..’ \n",
      "‘Oh come, that’s enough!’ said the other. \n",
      "‘What do I care? Let him hear! We’re not dogs,’ said \n",
      "the ex-captain of police, and looking round he noticed \n",
      "Alpatych. \n",
      "‘Oh, Yakov Alpatych! What have you come for?’ \n",
      "‘To see the Governor by his excellency’s order,’ \n",
      "answered Alpatych, lifting hi s head and proudly thrusting \n",
      "his hand into the bosom of his coat as he always did when \n",
      "he mentioned the prince.... He has ordered me to inquire \n",
      "into the position of affairs,’ he added. \n",
      "‘Yes, go and find out!’ shouted the angry gentleman. \n",
      "‘They’ve brought things to such a pass that there are no \n",
      "carts or anything!... There it is again, do you hear?’ said \n",
      "he, pointing in the direction whence came the sounds of \n",
      "firing. War and Peace  \n",
      "1632 of 2882 \n",
      "‘They’ve brought us all to  ruin... the brigands!’ he \n",
      "repeated, and descended the porch steps. \n",
      "Alpatych swayed his head and went upstairs. In the \n",
      "waiting room were tradesmen, women, and officials, \n",
      "looking silently at one another. The door of the \n",
      "Governor’s room opened and they all rose and moved \n",
      "forward. An official ran out, said some words to a \n",
      "merchant, called a stout offi cial with a cross hanging on \n",
      "his neck to follow him, and vanished again, evidently \n",
      "wishing to avoid the inqui ring looks and questions \n",
      "addressed to him. Alpatych moved forward and next time \n",
      "the official came out addressed him, one hand placed in \n",
      "the breast of his buttone d coat, and handed him two \n",
      "letters. \n",
      "‘To his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in-Chief \n",
      "Prince Bolkonski,’ he announced with such solemnity and \n",
      "significance that the official  turned to him and took the \n",
      "letters. \n",
      "A few minutes later the G overnor received Alpatych \n",
      "and hurriedly said to him: \n",
      "‘Inform the prince and princess that I knew nothing: I \n",
      "acted on the highest instructi ons- here...’ and he handed a \n",
      "paper to Alpatych. ‘Still, as the prince is unwell my \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1633 of 2882 \n",
      "advice is that they should go to Moscow. I am just starting \n",
      "myself. Inform them..’ \n",
      "But the Governor did not finish: a dusty perspiring \n",
      "officer ran into the room and began to say something in \n",
      "French. The Governor’s face expressed terror. \n",
      "‘Go,’ he said, nodding his head to Alpatych, and began \n",
      "questioning the officer. \n",
      "Eager, frightened, helpless glances were turned on \n",
      "Alpatych when he came out of the Governor’s room. \n",
      "Involuntarily listening now to the firing, which had drawn \n",
      "nearer and was increasing in strength, Alpatych hurried to \n",
      "his inn. The paper handed to him by the Governor said \n",
      "this: \n",
      "‘I assure you that the town of Smolensk is not in the \n",
      "slightest danger as yet and it is unlikely that it will be \n",
      "threatened with any. I from the one side and Prince \n",
      "Bagration from the other are marching to unite our forces \n",
      "before Smolensk, which junction will be effected on the \n",
      "22nd instant, and both armies with their united forces will \n",
      "defend our compatriots of th e province entrusted to your \n",
      "care till our efforts shall have  beaten back the enemies of \n",
      "our Fatherland, or till the last warrior in our valiant ranks \n",
      "has perished. From this you will see that you have a \n",
      "perfect right to reassure the inhabitants of Smolensk, for War and Peace  \n",
      "1634 of 2882 \n",
      "those defended by two such brave armies may feel \n",
      "assured of victory.’ (Instructions from Barclay de Tolly to \n",
      "Baron Asch, the civil governor of Smolensk, 1812.) \n",
      "People were anxiously roaming about the streets. \n",
      "Carts piled high with house hold utensils, chairs, and \n",
      "cupboards kept emerging from the gates of the yards and \n",
      "moving along the streets. Loaded carts stood at the house \n",
      "next to Ferapontov’s and women were wailing and \n",
      "lamenting as they said good-by. A small watchdog ran \n",
      "round barking in front of the harnessed horses. \n",
      "Alpatych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than \n",
      "usual and went straight to the shed where his horses and \n",
      "trap were. The coachman was asleep. He woke him up, \n",
      "told him to harness, and went into the passage. From the \n",
      "host’s room came the sounds  of a child crying, the \n",
      "despairing sobs of a wo man, and the hoarse angry \n",
      "shouting of Ferapontov. The cook began running hither \n",
      "and thither in the passage like a frightened hen, just as \n",
      "Alpatych entered. \n",
      "‘He’s done her to death. Killed the mistress!... Beat \n",
      "her... dragged her about so!..’ \n",
      "‘What for?’ asked Alpatych. \n",
      "‘She kept begging to go away. She’s a woman! ‘Take \n",
      "me away,’ says she, ‘don’t let me perish with my little \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1635 of 2882 \n",
      "children! Folks,’ she says, ‘are all gone, so why,’ she \n",
      "says, ‘don’t we go?’ And he  began beating and pulling \n",
      "her about so!’ \n",
      "At these words Alpatych nodded as if in approval, and \n",
      "not wishing to hear more went to the door of the room \n",
      "opposite the innkeeper’s, where he had left his purchases. \n",
      "‘You brute, you murderer!’ screamed a thin, pale \n",
      "woman who, with a baby in her arms and her kerchief \n",
      "torn from her head, burst through the door at that moment \n",
      "and down the steps into the yard. \n",
      "Ferapontov came out after her, but on seeing Alpatych \n",
      "adjusted his waistcoat, sm oothed his hair, yawned, and \n",
      "followed Alpatych into the opposite room. \n",
      "‘Going already?’ said he. \n",
      "Alpatych, without answeri ng or looking at his host, \n",
      "sorted his packages and asked how much he owed. \n",
      "‘We’ll reckon up! Well, have you been to the \n",
      "Governor’s?’ asked Fera pontov. ‘What has been \n",
      "decided?’ \n",
      "Alpatych replied that the Governor had not told him \n",
      "anything definite. \n",
      "‘With our business, how can we get away?’ said \n",
      "Ferapontov. ‘We’d have to pay seven rubles a cartload to \n",
      "Dorogobuzh and I tell them they’re not Christians to ask \n",

      "some tea?’ he added. \n",
      "While the horses were bei ng harnessed Alpatych and \n",
      "Ferapontov over their tea talked of the price of corn, the \n",
      "crops, and the good weather for harvesting. \n",
      "‘Well, it seems to be ge tting quieter,’ remarked \n",
      "Ferapontov, finishing his thir d cup of tea and getting up. \n",
      "‘Ours must have got the best of it. The orders were not to \n",

      "Alpatych collected his parcels, handed them to the \n",
      "coachman who had come in, and settled up with the \n",
      "innkeeper. The noise of wheels, hoofs, and bells was \n",
      "heard from the gateway as a little trap passed out. \n",
      "It was by now late in the af ternoon. Half the street was \n",
      "in shadow, the other half brightly lit by the sun. Alpatych \n",
      "looked out of the window and went to the door. Suddenly \n",
      "the strange sound of a far-off whistling and thud was \n",
      "heard, followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull \n",
      "roar that set the windows rattling. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1637 of 2882 \n",
      "He went out into the street: two men were running past \n",
      "toward the bridge. From different sides came whistling \n",
      "sounds and the thud of cannon balls and bursting shells \n",
      "falling on the town. But these sounds were hardly heard in \n",
      "comparison with the noise of the firing outside the town \n",
      "and attracted little attention from the inhabitants. The \n",
      "town was being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns \n",
      "which Napoleon had ordered up after four o’clock. The \n",
      "people did not at once realize the meaning of this \n",
      "bombardment. \n",
      "At first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only \n",
      "aroused curiosity. Ferapontov’s wife, who till then had \n",
      "not ceased wailing under the shed, became quiet and with \n",
      "the baby in her arms went to the gate, listening to the \n",
      "sounds and looking in silence at the people. \n",
      "The cook and a shop assistant came to the gate. With \n",
      "lively curiosity everyone tried to get a glimpse of the \n",
      "projectiles as they flew over their heads. Several people \n",
      "came round the corner talking eagerly. \n",
      "‘What force!’ remarked one . ‘Knocked the roof and \n",
      "ceiling all to splinters!’ \n",
      "‘Routed up the earth like a pig,’ said another. War and Peace  \n",
      "1638 of 2882 \n",
      "‘That’s grand, it bucks one up!’ laughed the first. \n",
      "‘Lucky you jumped aside, or  it would have wiped you \n",
      "out!’ \n",
      "Others joined those men and stopped and told how \n",
      "cannon balls had fallen on a house close to them. \n",
      "Meanwhile still more projec tiles, now with the swift \n",
      "sinister whistle of a cannon ball, now with the agreeable \n",
      "intermittent whistle of a shell, flew over people’s heads \n",
      "incessantly, but not one fell cl ose by, they all flew over. \n",
      "Alpatych was getting into his trap. The innkeeper stood at \n",
      "the gate. \n",
      "‘What are you staring at?’ he shouted to the cook, who \n",
      "in her red skirt, with sleeves  rolled up, swinging her bare \n",
      "elbows, had stepped to the co rner to listen to what was \n",
      "being said. \n",
      "‘What marvels!’ she exclaimed, but hearing her \n",
      "master’s voice she turned back. pulling down her tucked-\n",
      "up skirt. \n",
      "Once more something whistled, but this time quite \n",
      "close, swooping downwards like a little bird; a flame \n",
      "flashed in the middle of th e street, something exploded, \n",
      "and the street was shrouded in smoke. \n",
      "‘Scoundrel, what are you doing?’ shouted the \n",
      "innkeeper, rushing to the cook. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1639 of 2882 \n",
      "At that moment the pitiful wailing of women was \n",
      "heard from different sides, the frightened baby began to \n",
      "cry, and people crowded silently with pale faces round the \n",
      "cook. The loudest sound in that crowd was her wailing. \n",
      "‘Oh-h-h! Dear souls, dear kind souls! Don’t let me die! \n",
      "My good souls!..’ \n",
      "Five minutes later no one remained in the street. The \n",
      "cook, with her thigh broken by a shell splinter, had been \n",
      "carried into the kitchen. Alpatych, his coachman, \n",
      "Ferapontov’s wife and children and the house porter were \n",
      "all sitting in the cellar, lis tening. The roar of guns, the \n",
      "whistling of projectiles, and the piteous moaning of the \n",
      "cook, which rose above the other sounds, did not cease for \n",
      "a moment. The mistress rocked and hushed her baby and \n",
      "when anyone came into the cellar asked in a pathetic \n",
      "whisper what had become of her husband who had \n",
      "remained in the street. A shopman who entered told her \n",
      "that her husband had gone with  others to the cathedral, \n",
      "whence they were fetching the wonder-working icon of \n",
      "Smolensk. \n",
      "Toward dusk the cannonade began to subside. \n",
      "Alpatych left the cellar a nd stopped in the doorway. The \n",
      "evening sky that had been so clear was clouded with \n",
      "smoke, through which, high up, the sickle of the new War and Peace  \n",
      "1640 of 2882 \n",
      "moon shone strangely. Now that  the terrible din of the \n",
      "guns had ceased a hush seemed to reign over the town, \n",
      "broken only by the rustle of footsteps, the moaning, the \n",
      "distant cries, and the crackle of fires which seemed \n",
      "widespread everywhere. The cook’s moans had now \n",
      "subsided. On two sides black curling clouds of smoke \n",
      "rose and spread from the fires. Through the streets \n",
      "soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in \n",
      "different directions like ants from a ruined ant-hill. \n",
      "Several of them ran into Ferapontov’s yard before \n",
      "Alpatych’s eyes. Alpatych went out to the gate. A \n",
      "retreating regiment, thronging and hurrying, blocked the \n",
      "street. \n",
      "Noticing him, an officer said: ‘The town is being \n",
      "abandoned. Get away, get away!’ and then, turning to the \n",
      "soldiers, shouted: \n",
      "‘I’ll teach you to run into the yards!’ \n",
      "Alpatych went back to the house, called the coachman, \n",
      "and told him to set off. Ferapontov’s whole household \n",
      "came out too, following Alpatych and the coachman. The \n",
      "women, who had been silent till then, suddenly began to \n",
      "wail as they looked at the fi res- the smoke and even the \n",
      "flames of which could be seen  in the failing twilight- and \n",
      "as if in reply the same kind of lamentation was heard from \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1641 of 2882 \n",
      "other parts of the street. Insi de the shed Alpatych and the \n",

      "horses with trembling hands. \n",
      "As Alpatych was driving out of the gate he saw some \n",
      "ten soldiers in Ferapontov’s open shop, talking loudly and \n",
      "filling their bags and knapsacks with flour and sunflower \n",
      "seeds. Just then Ferapontov returned and entered his shop. \n",
      "On seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at them, but \n",
      "suddenly stopped and, clutching at his hair, burst into \n",
      "sobs and laughter: \n",
      "‘Loot everything, lads! Don’t let those devils get it!’ he \n",
      "cried, taking some bags of  flour himself and throwing \n",
      "them into the street. \n",
      "Some of the soldiers were frightened and ran away, \n",
      "others went on filling their bags. On seeing Alpatych, \n",

      "‘Russia is done for!’ he cried. ‘Alpatych, I’ll set the \n",
      "place on fire myself. We’re done for!...’ and Ferapontov \n",
      "ran into the yard. \n",
      "Soldiers were passing in a constant stream along the \n",
      "street blocking it completely, so that Alpatych could not \n",
      "pass out and had to wait. Ferapontov’s wife and children \n",

      "distinctness the faces of the people crowding at the \n",
      "crossroads. Black figures flitted about before the fire, and \n",
      "through the incessant crackling of the flames talking and \n",
      "shouting could be heard. Seeing that his trap would not be \n",
      "able to move on for some time, Alpatych got down and \n",
      "turned into the side street to look at the fire. Soldiers were \n",
      "continually rushing backwards and forwards near it, and \n",
      "he saw two of them and a man in a frieze coat dragging \n",
      "burning beams into another yard across the street, while \n",
      "others carried bundles of hay. \n",
      "Alpatych went up to a large crowd standing before a \n",
      "high barn which was blazing br iskly. The walls were all \n",
      "on fire and the back wall had fallen in, the wooden roof \n",
      "was collapsing, and the rafter s were alight. The crowd \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1643 of 2882 \n",
      "was evidently watching for the roof to fall in, and \n",
      "Alpatych watched for it too. \n",
      "‘Alpatych!’ a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old \n",
      "man. \n",
      "‘Mercy on us! Your excellency!’ answered Alpatych, \n",
      "immediately recognizing the voice of his young prince. \n",
      "Prince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black \n",
      "horse, was looking at Alpatych from the back of the \n",
      "crowd. \n",
      "‘Why are you here?’ he asked. \n",
      "‘Your... your excellency,’ stammered Alpatych and \n",
      "broke into sobs. ‘Are we really lost? Master!..’ \n",
      "‘Why are you here?’ Prince Andrew repeated. \n",
      "At that moment the flames flared up and showed his \n",
      "young master’s pale worn face. Alpatych told how he had \n",
      "been sent there and how difficult it was to get away. \n",
      "‘Are we really quite lost, your excellency?’ he asked \n",
      "again. \n",
      "Prince Andrew without replying took out a notebook \n",
      "and raising his knee began writi ng in pencil on a page he \n",
      "tore out. He wrote to his sister: \n",
      "‘Smolensk is being abandoned. Bald Hills will be \n",
      "occupied by the enemy within a week. Set off War and Peace  \n",
      "1644 of 2882 \n",
      "immediately for Moscow. Let me know at once when you \n",
      "will start. Send by special messenger to Usvyazh.’ \n",
      "Having written this and given the paper to Alpatych, \n",
      "he told him how to arrange for departure of the prince, the \n",
      "princess, his son, and the boy’s tutor, and how and where \n",
      "to let him know immediately. Before he had had time to \n",
      "finish giving these instructions, a chief of staff followed \n",
      "by a suite galloped up to him. \n",
      "‘You are a colonel?’ shouted the chief of staff with a \n",
      "German accent, in a voice fa miliar to Prince Andrew. \n",
      "‘Houses are set on fire in your presence and you stand by! \n",
      "What does this mean? You will answer for it!’ shouted \n",
      "Berg, who was now as sistant to the chief of staff of the \n",
      "commander of the left flank of the infantry of the first \n",
      "army, a place, as Berg said, ‘very agreeable and well en \n",
      "evidence.’ \n",
      "Prince Andrew looked at hi m and without replying \n",
      "went on speaking to Alpatych. \n",
      "‘So tell them that I shall await a reply till the tenth, and \n",
      "if by the tenth I don’t receive news that they have all got \n",
      "away I shall have to throw up everything and come \n",
      "myself to Bald Hills.’ \n",
      "‘Prince,’ said Berg, rec ognizing Prince Andrew, ‘I \n",
      "only spoke because I have to obey orders, because I \n",

      "1645 of 2882 \n",
      "always do obey exactly.... You must please excuse me,’ \n",
      "he went on apologetically. \n",
      "Something cracked in the flames. The fire died down \n",
      "for a moment and wreaths of black smoke rolled from \n",
      "under the roof. There was another terrible crash and \n",
      "something huge collapsed. \n",
      "‘Ou-rou-rou!’ yelled the cr owd, echoing the crash of \n",
      "the collapsing roof of the barn, the burning grain in which \n",
      "diffused a cakelike aroma all around. The flames flared up \n",
      "again, lighting the animated, delighted, exhausted faces of \n",
      "the spectators. \n",
      "The man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted: \n",
      "‘It’s fine, lads! Now it’s raging... It’s fine!’ \n",
      "‘That’s the owner himself,’ cried several voices. \n",
      "‘Well then,’ continued Prince Andrew to Alpatych, \n",
      "‘report to them as I have told you\"; and not replying a \n",
      "word to Berg who was now mu te beside him, he touched \n",
      "his horse and rode down the side street. War and Peace  \n",

      "From Smolensk the troops continued to retreat, \n",
      "followed by the enemy. On the tenth of August the \n",
      "regiment Prince Andrew commanded was marching along \n",
      "the highroad past the avenue leading to Bald Hills. Heat \n",
      "and drought had continued for more than three weeks. \n",
      "Each day fleecy clouds floated across the sky and \n",
      "occasionally veiled the sun, but toward evening the sky \n",
      "cleared again and the sun se t in reddish-brown mist. \n",
      "Heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth. The unreaped \n",
      "corn was scorched and shed its grain. The marshes dried \n",
      "up. The cattle lowed from hunger, finding no food on the \n",
      "sun-parched meadows. Only at  night and in the forests \n",
      "while the dew lasted was there any freshness. But on the \n",
      "road, the highroad along which the troops marched, there \n",
      "was no such freshness even at night or when the road \n",
      "passed through the forest; the dew was imperceptible on \n",
      "the sandy dust churned up more than six inches deep. As \n",
      "soon as day dawned the march began. The artillery and \n",
      "baggage wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust \n",
      "that rose to the very hubs of  the wheels, and the infantry \n",
      "sank ankle-deep in that soft, choking, hot dust that never \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1647 of 2882 \n",
      "cooled even at night. Some of this dust was kneaded by \n",
      "the feet and wheels, while the rest rose and hung like a \n",
      "cloud over the troops, settling in eyes, ears, hair, and \n",
      "nostrils, and worst of all in  the lungs of the men and \n",
      "beasts as they moved along that road. The higher the sun \n",
      "rose the higher rose that cloud of dust, and through the \n",
      "screen of its hot fine partic les one could look with naked \n",
      "eye at the sun, which showed like a huge crimson ball in \n",
      "the unclouded sky. There was no wind, and the men \n",
      "choked in that motionless atmosphere. They marched with \n",
      "handkerchiefs tied over their noses and mouths. When \n",
      "they passed through a village th ey all rushed to the wells \n",
      "and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud. \n",
      "Prince Andrew was in command of a regiment, and the \n",
      "management of that regiment , the welfare of the men and \n",
      "the necessity of receiving and giving orders, engrossed \n",
      "him. The burning of Smolensk and its abandonment made \n",
      "an epoch in his life. A novel feeling of anger against the \n",
      "foe made him forget his ow n sorrow. He was entirely \n",
      "devoted to the affairs of his regiment and was considerate \n",
      "and kind to his men and officer s. In the regiment they \n",
      "called him ‘our prince,’ were proud of him and loved him. \n",
      "But he was kind and gentle only to those of his regiment, \n",
      "to Timokhin and the like- people quite new to him, \n",

      "1648 of 2882 \n",
      "belonging to a different wo rld and who could not know \n",
      "and understand his past. As soon as he came across a \n",
      "former acquaintance or anyone from the staff, he bristled \n",
      "up immediately and grew spiteful, ironical, and \n",
      "contemptuous. Everything that reminded him of his past \n",
      "was repugnant to him, and so in his relations with that \n",
      "former circle he confined hi mself to trying to do his duty \n",
      "and not to be unfair. \n",
      "In truth everything presented itself in a dark and \n",
      "gloomy light to Prince Andr ew, especially after the \n",
      "abandonment of Smolensk on the sixth of August (he \n",
      "considered that it could a nd should have been defended) \n",
      "and after his sick father ha d had to flee to Moscow, \n",
      "abandoning to pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which \n",
      "he had built and peopled. But despite this, thanks to his \n",
      "regiment, Prince Andrew had something to think about \n",
      "entirely apart from general questions. Two days \n",
      "previously he had received ne ws that his father, son, and \n",
      "sister had left for Moscow; and though there was nothing \n",
      "for him to do at Bald Hills, Prince Andrew with a \n",
      "characteristic desire to fome nt his own grief decided that \n",
      "he must ride there. \n",
      "He ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his \n",
      "regiment on the march, rode to his father’s estate where \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1649 of 2882 \n",
      "he had been born and spent his childhood. Riding past the \n",
      "pond where there used always  to be dozens of women \n",
      "chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden \n",
      "beetles, Prince Andrew noticed that there was not a soul \n",
      "about and that the little washing wharf, torn from its place \n",
      "and half submerged, was floating on its side in the middle \n",
      "of the pond. He rode to the keeper’s lodge. No one at the \n",
      "stone entrance gates of the drive and the door stood open. \n",
      "Grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths, and \n",
      "horses and calves were straying in the English park. \n",
      "Prince Andrew rode up to the hothouse; some of the glass \n",
      "panes were broken, and of the trees in tubs some were \n",
      "overturned and others dried up. He called for Taras the \n",
      "gardener, but no one repl ied. Having gone round the \n",
      "corner of the hothouse to the ornamental garden, he saw \n",
      "that the carved garden fence was broken and branches of \n",
      "the plum trees had been torn off with the fruit. An old \n",
      "peasant whom Prince Andrew in his childhood had often \n",
      "seen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat, \n",
      "plaiting a bast shoe. \n",
      "He was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew ride up. \n",
      "He was sitting on the seat the old prince used to like to sit \n",
      "on, and beside him strips of bast were hanging on the \n",
      "broken and withered branch of a magnolia. War and Peace  \n",
      "1650 of 2882 \n",
      "Prince Andrew rode up to the house. Several limes in \n",
      "the old garden had been cut down and a piebald mare and \n",
      "her foal were wandering in front of the house among the \n",
      "rosebushes. The shutters were  all closed, except at one \n",
      "window which was open. A little serf boy, seeing Prince \n",
      "Andrew, ran into the house. Alpatych, having sent his \n",
      "family away, was alone at Bald Hills and was sitting \n",
      "indoors reading the Lives of th e Saints. On hearing that \n",
      "Prince Andrew had come, he went out with his spectacles \n",
      "on his nose, buttoning his co at, and, hastily stepping up, \n",
      "without a word began weeping and kissing Prince \n",
      "Andrew’s knee. \n",
      "Then, vexed at his own weakness, he turned away and \n",
      "began to report on the positi on of affairs. Everything \n",
      "precious and valuable had been removed to Bogucharovo. \n",
      "Seventy quarters of grain had also been carted away. The \n",
      "hay and the spring corn, of which Alpatych said there had \n",
      "been a remarkable crop that year, had been \n",
      "commandeered by the troops and mown down while still \n",
      "green. The peasants were ruined; some of them too had \n",
      "gone to Bogucharovo, only a few remained. \n",
      "Without waiting to hear him out, Prince Andrew asked: \n",
      "‘When did my father and sister leave?’ meaning when \n",
      "did they leave for Moscow. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1651 of 2882 \n",
      "Alpatych, understanding the question to refer to their \n",
      "departure for Bogucharovo, replied that they had left on \n",
      "the seventh and again went into details concerning the \n",
      "estate management, asking for instructions. \n",
      "‘Am I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a \n",
      "receipt for them? We have still six hundred quarters left,’ \n",
      "he inquired. \n",
      "‘What am I to say to him?’ thought Prince Andrew, \n",
      "looking down on the old man’s bald head shining in the \n",
      "sun and seeing by the expression on his face that the old \n",
      "man himself understood how untimely such questions \n",
      "were and only asked them to allay his grief. \n",
      "‘Yes, let them have it,’ replied Prince Andrew. \n",
      "‘If you noticed some disorder  in the garden,’ said \n",
      "Alpatych, ‘it was impossibl e to prevent it. Three \n",
      "regiments have been here and spent the night, dragoons \n",
      "mostly. I took down the name and rank of their \n",
      "commanding officer, to hand in a complaint about it.’ \n",
      "‘Well, and what are you going to do? Will you stay \n",
      "here if the enemy occupies the place?’ asked Prince \n",
      "Andrew. \n",
      "Alpatych turned his face to  Prince Andrew, looked at \n",
      "him, and suddenly with a solemn gesture raised his arm. \n",
      "‘He is my refuge! His will be done!’ he exclaimed. War and Peace  \n",
      "1652 of 2882 \n",
      "A group of bareheaded peasants was approaching \n",
      "across the meadow toward the prince. \n",
      "‘Well, good-by!’ said Prince Andrew, bending over to \n",
      "Alpatych. ‘You must go away too, take away what you \n",
      "can and tell the serfs to go to the Ryazan estate or to the \n",
      "one near Moscow.’ \n",
      "Alpatych clung to Prince Andrew’s leg and burst into \n",
      "sobs. Gently disengaging himsel f, the prince spurred his \n",
      "horse and rode down the avenue at a gallop. \n",
      "The old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden, \n",
      "like a fly impassive on the f ace of a loved one who is \n",
      "dead, tapping the last on wh ich he was making the bast \n",
      "shoe, and two little girls, running out from the hot house \n",
      "carrying in their skirts plum s they had plucked from the \n",
      "trees there, came upon Prince Andrew. On seeing the \n",
      "young master, the elder one fri ghtened look clutched her \n",
      "younger companion by the hand and hid with her behind a \n",
      "birch tree, not stopping to pick  up some green plums they \n",
      "had dropped. \n",
      "Prince Andrew turned away with startled haste, \n",
      "unwilling to let them see that they had been observed. He \n",
      "was sorry for the pretty frightened little girl, was afraid of \n",
      "looking at her, and yet felt an irresistible desire to do so. \n",
      "A new sensation of comfort and relief came over him \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1653 of 2882 \n",
      "when, seeing these girls, he realized the existence of other \n",
      "human interests entirely aloof  from his own and just as \n",
      "legitimate as those that occupied him. Evidently these \n",
      "girls passionately desired one thing- to carry away and eat \n",
      "those green plums without being caught- and Prince \n",
      "Andrew shared their wish for the success of their \n",
      "enterprise. He could not resist looking at them once more. \n",
      "Believing their danger past , they sprang from their \n",
      "ambush and, chirruping someth ing in their shrill little \n",
      "voices and holding up their skirts, their bare little \n",
      "sunburned feet scampered merrily and quickly across the \n",
      "meadow grass. \n",
      "Prince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by having \n",
      "ridden off the dusty highroad along which the troops were \n",
      "moving. But not far from Bald Hills he again came out on \n",
      "the road and overtook his regime nt at its halting place by \n",
      "the dam of a small pond. It was past one o’clock. The sun, \n",
      "a red ball through the dust, bur ned and scorched his back \n",
      "intolerably through his black  coat. The dust always hung \n",
      "motionless above the buzz of talk that came from the \n",
      "resting troops. There was no wind. As he crossed the dam \n",
      "Prince Andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the \n",
      "pond. He longed to get into that water, however dirty it \n",
      "might be, and he glanced round at the pool from whence War and Peace  \n",
      "1654 of 2882 \n",
      "came sounds of shrieks and laughter. The small, muddy, \n",
      "green pond had risen visibly more than a foot, flooding \n",
      "the dam, because it was full of the naked white bodies of \n",
      "soldiers with brick-red hands, necks, and faces, who were \n",
      "splashing about in it. All this naked white human flesh, \n",
      "laughing and shrieking, flounde red about in that dirty \n",
      "pool like carp stuffed into a watering can, and the \n",
      "suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass \n",
      "rendered it specially pathetic. \n",
      "One fair-haired young soldier of the third company, \n",
      "whom Prince Andrew knew and who had a strap round \n",
      "the calf of one leg, crossed himself, stepped back to get a \n",
      "good run, and plunged into the water; another, a dark \n",
      "noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy, stood \n",
      "up to his waist in the water joyfully wriggling his \n",
      "muscular figure and snorted with satisfaction as he poured \n",
      "the water over his head with hands blackened to the \n",
      "wrists. There were sounds of  men slapping one another, \n",
      "yelling, and puffing. \n",
      "Everywhere on the bank, on the dam, and in the pond, \n",
      "there was healthy, white, muscular flesh. The officer, \n",
      "Timokhin, with his red little nose, standing on the dam \n",
      "wiping himself with a towel, felt confused at seeing the \n",
      "prince, but made up his mind to address him nevertheless. \n",

      "1655 of 2882 \n",
      "‘It’s very nice, your excellency! Wouldn’t you like to?’ \n",

      "‘It’s dirty,’ replied Prince Andrew, making a grimace. \n",
      "‘We’ll clear it out for you in a minute,’ said Timokhin, \n",

      "‘What prince? Ours?’ said many voices, and the men \n",
      "were in such haste to clear out that the prince could hardly \n",
      "stop them. He decided that he  would rather himself with \n",
      "water in the barn. \n",
      "‘Flesh, bodies, cannon fodder!’ he thought, and he \n",
      "looked at his own naked body and shuddered, not from \n",
      "cold but from a sense of disgust and horror he did not \n",

      "1676 of 2882 \n",
      "their midst several men were  supporting by the armpits \n",

      "sunlight that fell in small round spots through the shade of \n",
      "the lime-tree avenue, could not be sure what change there \n",
      "was in his face. All she could see was that his former \n",
      "stern and determined expression had altered to one of \n",
      "timidity and submission. On seeing his daughter he \n",
      "moved his helpless lips and ma de a hoarse sound. It was \n",
      "impossible to make out what he wanted. He was lifted up, \n",
      "carried to his study, and laid on the very couch he had so \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1677 of 2882 \n",
      "corpse. He muttered unceasingly, his eyebrows and lips \n",
      "twitching, and it was impossi ble to tell whether he \n",
      "understood what was going on around him or not. One \n",
      "thing was certain- that he was suffering and wished to say \n",
      "something. But what it was, no one could tell: it might be \n",
      "some caprice of a sick and half-crazy man, or it might \n",
      "relate to public affairs, or possibly to family concerns. \n",
      "The doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything \n",
      "and was due to physical cau ses; but Princess Mary \n",
      "thought he wished to tell her something, and the fact that \n",
      "her presence always increased  his restlessness confirmed \n",
      "her opinion. \n",
      "He was evidently suffering both physically and \n",
      "mentally. There was no hope of recovery. It was \n",

      "symptoms of the approach of the end. \n",
      "Strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in \n",

      "terrible to her was that since her father’s illness began War and Peace  \n",
      "1678 of 2882 \n",
      "(perhaps even sooner, wh en she stayed with him \n",
      "expecting something to happen), all the personal desires \n",
      "and hopes that had been forgo tten or sleeping within her \n",

      "years- thoughts of a life free fr om the fear of her father, \n",
      "and even the possibility of l ove and of family happiness- \n",
      "floated continually in her imagination like temptations of \n",
      "the devil. Thrust them aside as she would, questions \n",
      "continually recurred to her as  to how she would order her \n",
      "life now, after that. These were temptations of the devil \n",
      "and Princess Mary knew it. She knew that the sole \n",
      "weapon against him was prayer, and she tried to pray. She \n",
      "assumed an attitude of pr ayer, looked at the icons, \n",
      "repeated the words of a pray er, but she could not pray. \n",
      "She felt that a different wo rld had now taken possession \n",
      "of her- the life of a world of strenuous and free activity, \n",
      "quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she \n",
      "had been confined and in wh ich her greatest comfort had \n",
      "been prayer. She could not pray, could not weep, and \n",
      "worldly cares took possession of her. \n",
      "It was becoming dangerous to remain in Bogucharovo. \n",
      "News of the approach of the French came from all sides, \n",

      "official to Princess Mary to persuade her to  get away as \n",
      "quickly as possible, and the head of the rural police \n",
      "having come to Bogucharovo urged the same thing, \n",
      "saying that the French were only some twenty-five miles \n",
      "away, that French proclamati ons were circulating in the \n",
      "villages, and that if the prin cess did not take her father \n",
      "away before the fifteenth, he  could not answer for the \n",

      "The princess decided to leave on the fifteenth. The \n",

      "night of the fourteenth as usual, without undressing, in the \n",
      "room next to the one where the prince lay. Several times, \n",
      "waking up, she heard his groans and muttering, the creak \n",
      "of his bed, and the steps of  Tikhon and the doctor when \n",
      "they turned him over. Several times she listened at the \n",
      "door, and it seemed to her that his mutterings were louder \n",
      "than usual and that they turned him over oftener. She \n",
      "could not sleep and several times went to the door and \n",
      "listened, wishing to enter but not deciding to do so. \n",
      "Though he did not speak, Princess Mary saw and knew \n",
      "how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was War and Peace  \n",
      "1680 of 2882 \n",
      "to him. She had noticed with what dissatisfaction he \n",
      "turned from the look she sometimes involuntarily fixed on \n",
      "him. She knew that her going in during the night at an \n",
      "unusual hour would irritate him. \n",
      "But never had she felt so grieved for him or so much \n",
      "afraid of losing him. She recalled all her life with him and \n",
      "in every word and act of hi s found an expression of his \n",
      "love of her. Occasionally amid these memories \n",
      "temptations of the devil would surge into her imagination: \n",
      "thoughts of how things would be  after his death, and how \n",
      "her new, liberated life would be ordered. But she drove \n",
      "these thoughts away with di sgust. Toward morning he \n",
      "became quiet and she fell asleep. \n",
      "She woke late. That sincerity which often comes with \n",
      "waking showed her clearly what chiefly concerned her \n",
      "about her father’s illness. On waking she listened to what \n",
      "was going on behind the door and, hearing him groan, \n",
      "said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same. \n",
      "‘But what could have happe ned? What did I want? I \n",

      "herself. \n",
      "She washed, dressed, said her prayers, and went out to \n",
      "the porch. In front of it stood carriages without horses and \n",
      "things were being packed into the vehicles. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1681 of 2882 \n",
      "It was a warm, gray morning. Princess Mary stopped at \n",
      "the porch, still horrified by her spiritual baseness and \n",
      "trying to arrange her thoughts before going to her father. \n",
      "The doctor came downstairs and went out to her. \n",
      "‘He is a little better today,’ said he. ‘I was looking for \n",
      "you. One can make out something of what he is saying. \n",
      "His head is clearer. Come in, he is asking for you..’ \n",
      "Princess Mary’s heart beat so violently at this news \n",
      "that she grew pale and leaned against the wall to keep \n",
      "from falling. To see him, talk to him, feel his eyes on her \n",
      "now that her whole soul was overflowing with those \n",
      "dreadful, wicked temptations, was a torment of joy and \n",
      "terror. \n",
      "‘Come,’ said the doctor. \n",
      "Princess Mary entered her father’s room and went up \n",
      "to his bed. He was lying on his back propped up high, and \n",
      "his small bony hands with their knotted purple veins were \n",
      "lying on the quilt; his left ey e gazed straight before him, \n",
      "his right eye was awry, and his brows and lips motionless. \n",
      "He seemed altogether so thin, small, and pathetic. His \n",
      "face seemed to have shriveled or melted; his features had \n",
      "grown smaller. Princess Ma ry went up and kissed his \n",
      "hand. His left hand pressed hers so that she understood \n",
      "that he had long been waiting for her to come. He War and Peace  \n",
      "1682 of 2882 \n",
      "twitched her hand, and his brows and lips quivered \n",
      "angrily. \n",
      "She looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he \n",
      "wanted of her. When she cha nged her position so that his \n",
      "left eye could see her face he calmed down, not taking his \n",
      "eyes off her for some seconds. Then his lips and tongue \n",
      "moved, sounds came, and he began to speak, gazing \n",
      "timidly and imploringly at her, evidently afraid that she \n",
      "might not understand. \n",
      "Straining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him. \n",
      "The comic efforts with which he moved his tongue made \n",
      "her drop her eyes and with diffi culty repress the sobs that \n",
      "rose to her throat. He said something, repeating the same \n",
      "words several times. She could not understand them, but \n",
      "tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly \n",
      "repeated the words he uttered. \n",
      "‘Mmm...ar...ate...ate...’ he repeated several times. \n",
      "It was quite impossible to  understand these sounds. \n",
      "The doctor thought he had gue ssed them, and inquiringly \n",
      "repeated: ‘Mary, are you afra id?’ The prince shook his \n",
      "head, again repeated the same sounds. \n",
      "‘My mind, my mind aches?’ questioned Princess Mary. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1683 of 2882 \n",
      "He made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this, \n",
      "took her hand, and began pressi ng it to different parts of \n",
      "his breast as if trying to find the right place for it. \n",
      "‘Always thoughts... about you... thoughts...’ he then \n",
      "uttered much more clearly th an he had done before, now \n",
      "that he was sure of being understood. \n",
      "Princess Mary pressed her head against his hand, \n",
      "trying to hide her sobs and tears. \n",
      "He moved his hand over her hair. \n",
      "‘I have been calling you all night...’ he brought out. \n",
      "‘If only I had known...’ she sa id through her tears. ‘I \n",
      "was afraid to come in.’ \n",
      "He pressed her hand. \n",
      "‘Weren’t you asleep?’ \n",
      "‘No, I did not sleep,’ said Princess Mary, shaking her \n",
      "head. \n",
      "Unconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to \n",
      "express herself as he did, as  much as possible by signs, \n",
      "and her tongue too seemed to move with difficulty. \n",
      "‘Dear one... Dearest...’ Princess Mary could not quite \n",
      "make out what he had said, but  from his look it was clear \n",
      "that he had uttered a tender caressing word such as he had \n",
      "never used to her before. ‘Why didn’t you come in?’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1684 of 2882 \n",
      "‘And I was wishing for his death!’ thought Princess \n",
      "Mary. \n",
      "He was silent awhile. \n",
      "‘Thank you... daughter dear!... for all, for all... \n",
      "forgive!... thank you!... forgive!... thank you!...’ and tears \n",
      "began to flow from his eyes . ‘Call Andrew!’ he said \n",
      "suddenly, and a childish, timid expression of doubt \n",
      "showed itself on his face as he spoke. \n",
      "He himself seemed aware that his demand was \n",
      "meaningless. So at least it seemed to Princess Mary. \n",
      "‘I have a letter from him,’ she replied. \n",
      "He glanced at her with timid surprise. \n",
      "‘Where is he?’ \n",
      "‘He’s with the army, Father, at Smolensk.’ \n",
      "He closed his eyes and remained silent a long time. \n",
      "Then as if in answer to his doubts and to c onfirm the fact \n",
      "that now he understood and remembered everything, he \n",
      "nodded his head and reopened his eyes. \n",
      "‘Yes,’ he said, softly a nd distinctly. ‘Russia has \n",
      "perished. They’ve destroyed her.’ \n",
      "And he began to sob, and again tears flowed from his \n",
      "eyes. Princess Mary could no longer restrain herself and \n",
      "wept while she gazed at his face. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1685 of 2882 \n",
      "Again he closed his eyes. His sobs ceased, he pointed \n",
      "to his eyes, and Tikhon, unde rstanding him, wiped away \n",
      "the tears. \n",
      "Then he again opened his eyes and said something \n",
      "none of them could understand for a long time, till at last \n",
      "Tikhon understood and repeated  it. Princess Mary had \n",
      "sought the meaning of his words in the mood in which he \n",
      "had just been speaking. She thought he was speaking of \n",
      "Russia, or Prince Andrew, of herself, of his grandson, or \n",
      "of his own death, and so she could not guess his words. \n",
      "‘Put on your white dress. I like it,’ was what he said. \n",
      "Having understood this Princess Mary sobbed still \n",
      "louder, and the doctor taking her arm led her out to the \n",
      "veranda, soothing her and tr ying to persuade her to \n",
      "prepare for her journey. When she had left the room the \n",
      "prince again began speaking about his son, about the war, \n",
      "and about the Emperor, angrily twitching his brows and \n",
      "raising his hoarse voice, and then he had a second and \n",
      "final stroke. \n",
      "Princess Mary stayed on the veranda. The day had \n",
      "cleared, it was hot and sunny. She could understand \n",
      "nothing, think of nothing and feel nothing, except \n",
      "passionate love for her father, love such as she thought \n",
      "she had never felt till that moment. She ran out sobbing War and Peace  \n",
      "1686 of 2882 \n",
      "into the garden and as far as the pond, along the avenues \n",
      "of young lime trees Prince Andrew had planted. \n",
      "‘Yes... I... I... I wished for his death! Yes, I wanted it to \n",
      "end quicker.... I wished to be  at peace.... And what will \n",
      "become of me? What use w ill peace be when he is no \n",
      "longer here?’ Princess Mary murmured, pacing the garden \n",
      "with hurried steps and pressi ng her hands to her bosom \n",
      "which heaved with convulsive sobs. \n",
      "When she had completed the tour of the garden, which \n",
      "brought her again to the hous e, she saw Mademoiselle \n",
      "Bourienne- who had remained at Bogucharovo and did \n",
      "not wish to leave it- coming toward her with a stranger. \n",
      "This was the Marshal of the N obility of the district, who \n",
      "had come personally to point  out to the princess the \n",
      "necessity for her prompt departure. Princess Mary listened \n",
      "without understanding him; she led him to the house, \n",
      "offered him lunch, and sat down with him. Then, excusing \n",
      "herself, she went to the door of the old prince’s room. The \n",
      "doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could \n",
      "not enter. \n",
      "‘Go away, Princess! Go away... go away!’ \n",
      "She returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at \n",
      "the foot of the slope by the pond, where no one could see \n",
      "her. She did not know how long she had been there when \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1687 of 2882 \n",
      "she was aroused by the sound of a woman’s footsteps \n",
      "running along the path. She rose and saw Dunyasha her \n",
      "maid, who was evidently looking for her, and who \n",
      "stopped suddenly as if in alarm on seeing her mistress. \n",
      "‘Please come, Princess... The Prince,’ said Dunyasha \n",
      "in a breaking voice. \n",
      "‘Immediately, I’m coming, I’m coming!’ replied the \n",
      "princess hurriedly, not givi ng Dunyasha time to finish \n",
      "what she was saying, and trying to avoid seeing the girl \n",
      "she ran toward the house. \n",
      "‘Princess, it’s God’s will! You must be prepared for \n",
      "everything,’ said the Marshal, meeting her at the house \n",
      "door. \n",
      "‘Let me alone; it’s not true!’ she cried angrily to him. \n",
      "The doctor tried to stop her. She pushed him aside and \n",
      "ran to her father’s door. ‘Why are these people with \n",
      "frightened faces stopping me? I don’t want any of them! \n",
      "And what are they doing here?’ she thought. She opened \n",
      "the door and the bright dayl ight in that previously \n",

      "Again Princess Mary tried to catch someone’s eye, but \n",
      "not a single eye in the crowd was turned to her; evidently \n",

      "awkward. \n",

      "stillness reigned over the village and the house. \n",
      "Pictures of the near past- he r father’s illness and last \n",

      "these pictures presented themselves to her so clearly and \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1717 of 2882 \n",
      "in such detail that they s eemed now present, now past, \n",
      "and now future. \n",
      "She vividly recalled the mome nt when he had his first \n",
      "stroke and was being dragged along by his armpits \n",
      "through the garden at Bald Hills, muttering something \n",
      "with his helpless tongue, twitc hing his gray eyebrows and \n",
      "looking uneasily and timidly at her. \n",
      "‘Even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the \n",

      "Bald Hills before he had th e last stroke, when with a \n",
      "foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against \n",
      "his will. She had not slept and had stolen downstairs on \n",
      "tiptoe, and going to the door of the conservatory where he \n",
      "slept that night had listened at  the door. In a suffering and \n",
      "weary voice he was saying something to Tikhon, speaking \n",
      "of the Crimea and its warm nights and of the Empress. \n",
      "Evidently he had wanted to talk. ‘And why didn’t he call \n",
      "me? Why didn’t he let me be there instead of Tikhon?’ \n",
      "Princess Mary had thought and thought again now. ‘Now \n",
      "he will never tell anyone what  he had in his soul. Never \n",
      "will that moment return for him or for me when he might \n",
      "have said all he longed to say, and not Tikhon but I might \n",
      "have heard and understood him. Why didn’t I enter the War and Peace  \n",
      "1718 of 2882 \n",
      "room?’ she thought. ‘Perhaps he would then have said to \n",
      "me what he said the day he  died. While talking to Tikhon \n",
      "he asked about me twice. He wanted to see me, and I was \n",
      "standing close by, outside the door. It was sad and painful \n",
      "for him to talk to Tikhon who did not understand him. I \n",
      "remember how he began speaking to him about Lise as if \n",
      "she were alive- he had forgotten she was dead- and \n",
      "Tikhon reminded him that she was no more, and he \n",
      "shouted, ‘Fool!’ He was greatly depressed. From behind \n",
      "the door I heard how he lay down on his bed groaning and \n",
      "loudly exclaimed, ‘My God!’ Why didn’t I go in then? \n",
      "What could he have done to me? What could I have lost? \n",
      "And perhaps he would then have been comforted and \n",
      "would have said that word to me.’ And Princess Mary \n",
      "uttered aloud the caressing word  he had said to her on the \n",
      "day of his death. ‘Dear-est!’  she repeated, and began \n",
      "sobbing, with tears that reli eved her soul. She now saw \n",
      "his face before her. And not the face she had known ever \n",
      "since she could remember and had always seen at a \n",
      "distance, but the timid, feeble face she had seen for the \n",
      "first time quite closely, with all its wrinkles and details, \n",

      "her with the expression that was on his face as he lay in \n",
      "his coffin with his chin bound up with a white \n",
      "handkerchief. And the horror that had seized her when she \n",

      "For the last three days B ogucharovo had lain between \n",
      "the two hostile armies, so that it was as easy for the \n",
      "Russian rearguard to get to it as for the French vanguard; \n",
      "Rostov, as a careful squadron commander, wished to take \n",
      "such provisions as remained at Bogucharovo before the \n",
      "French could get them. \n",

      "way to Bogucharovo, a princely estate with a dwelling \n",
      "house and farm where they hoped to find many domestic \n",
      "serfs and pretty girls, they  questioned Lavrushka about \n",
      "Napoleon and laughed at his stories, and raced one \n",
      "another to try Ilyin’s horse. \n",
      "Rostov had no idea that the village he was entering \n",

      "1721 of 2882 \n",
      "Rostov and Ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race \n",
      "along the incline before reaching Bogucharovo, and \n",
      "Rostov, outstripping Ilyin, was the first to gallop into the \n",
      "village street. \n",
      "‘You’re first!’ cried Ilyin, flushed. \n",
      "‘Yes, always first both on the grassland and here,’ \n",

      "‘And I’d have won on my Frenchy, your excellency,’ \n",

      "Some of the men bared their h eads, others stared at the \n",

      "from the tavern, smiling, staggering, and singing some \n",

      "‘Who do you belong to?’ he asked. \n",
      "‘The French,’ replied Ilyi n jestingly, ‘and here is \n",
      "Napoleon himself’- and he pointed to Lavrushka. \n",
      "‘Then you are Russians?’ the peasant asked again. \n",
      "‘And is there a large force of you here?’ said another, a \n",
      "short man, coming up. \n",
      "‘Very large,’ answered Rostov. ‘But why have you \n",
      "collected here?’ he added. ‘Is it a holiday?’ \n",
      "‘The old men have met to talk over the business of the \n",
      "commune,’ replied the peasant, moving away. \n",
      "At that moment, on the road leading from the big \n",

      "coming toward the officers. \n",
      "‘The one in pink is mine, so keep off!’ said Ilyin on \n",
      "seeing Dunyasha running resolutely toward him. \n",
      "‘She’ll be ours!’ said Lavrushka to Ilyin, winking. \n",

      "‘This is Count Rostov, squadron commander, and I am \n",

      "having bared his head while still at a distance. \n",
      "‘May I make bold to trouble your honor?’ said he \n",
      "respectfully, but with a shade of contempt for the \n",
      "youthfulness of this officer and with a hand thrust into his \n",
      "bosom. ‘My mistress, daughter of General in Chief Prince \n",
      "Nicholas Bolkonski who died on the fifteenth of this \n",

      "‘Ah!... Alpatych... Ah, Ya kov Alpatych... Grand! \n",
      "Forgive us for Christ’s sake, eh?’ said the peasants, \n",
      "smiling joyfully at him. \n",
      "Rostov looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled. \n",
      "‘Or perhaps they amus e your honor?’ remarked \n",
      "Alpatych with a staid air, as  he pointed at the old men \n",
      "with his free hand. \n",
      "‘No, there’s not much to be amused at here,’ said \n",
      "Rostov, and rode on a little way. ‘What’s the matter?’ he \n",

      "1724 of 2882 \n",
      "‘I make bold to inform your honor that the rude \n",

      "though everything has been packed up since morning, her \n",
      "excellency cannot get away.’ \n",
      "‘Impossible!’ exclaimed Rostov. \n",
      "‘I have the honor to report to you the actual truth,’ said \n",
      "Alpatych. \n",
      "Rostov dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and \n",
      "followed Alpatych to the house,  questioning him as to the \n",
      "state of affairs. It appeared th at the princess’ offer of corn \n",
      "to the peasants the previous day, and her talk with Dron \n",
      "and at the meeting, had actually had so bad an effect that \n",
      "Dron had finally given up the keys and joined the \n",
      "peasants and had not appeared when Alpatych sent for \n",
      "him; and that in the morning when the princess gave \n",
      "orders to harness for her journey, the peasants had come \n",
      "in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would \n",
      "not let her leave the village: that there was an order not to \n",
      "move, and that they would unharness the horses. Alpatych \n",
      "had gone out to admonish them, but was told (it was \n",
      "chiefly Karp who did the talking, Dron not showing \n",
      "himself in the crowd) that they could not let the princess \n",
      "go, that there was an order to the contrary, but that if she \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1725 of 2882 \n",
      "stayed they would serve her as before and obey her in \n",
      "everything. \n",
      "At the moment when Rostov and Ilyin were galloping \n",
      "along the road, Princess Mary, despite the dissuasions of \n",
      "Alpatych, her nurse, and the ma ids, had given orders to \n",
      "harness and intended to start,  but when the cavalrymen \n",
      "were espied they were taken for Frenchmen, the \n",
      "coachman ran away, and the women in the house began to \n",
      "wail. \n",
      "‘Father! Benefactor! God has sent you!’ exclaimed \n",
      "deeply moved voices as Rostov passed through the \n",
      "anteroom. \n",
      "Princess Mary was sitting he lpless and bewildered in \n",
      "the large sitting room, when  Rostov was shown in. She \n",
      "could not grasp who he was and why he had come, or \n",
      "what was happening to her. When she saw his Russian \n",
      "face, and by his walk and the first words he uttered \n",
      "recognized him as a man of her own class, she glanced at \n",
      "him with her deep radiant look and began speaking in a \n",
      "voice that faltered and trembled with emotion. This \n",
      "meeting immediately struck Rostov as a romantic event. \n",
      "‘A helpless girl overwhelmed with grief, left to the mercy \n",
      "of coarse, rioting peasants! A nd what a strange fate sent \n",
      "me here! What gentleness a nd nobility there are in her War and Peace  \n",
      "1726 of 2882 \n",
      "features and expression!’ t hought he as he looked at her \n",
      "and listened to her timid story. \n",
      "When she began to tell him that all this had happened \n",
      "the day after her father’s f uneral, her voiced trembled. \n",
      "She turned away, and then, as if fearing he might take her \n",
      "words as meant to move him to pity, looked at him with \n",
      "an apprehensive glance of inquiry. There were tears in \n",
      "Rostov’s eyes. Princess Mary noticed this and glanced \n",
      "gratefully at him with that radiant look which caused the \n",
      "plainness of her face to be forgotten. \n",
      "‘I cannot express, Princess,  how glad I am that I \n",
      "happened to ride here and am able to show my readiness \n",
      "to serve you,’ said Rostov, rising. ‘Go when you please, \n",
      "and I give you my word of honor  that no one shall dare to \n",
      "cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as \n",
      "your escort.’ And bowing respectf ully, as if to a lady of \n",
      "royal blood, he moved toward the door. \n",
      "Rostov’s deferential tone seemed to indicate that \n",
      "though he would consider himself happy to be acquainted \n",
      "with her, he did not wish to take advantage of her \n",
      "misfortunes to intrude upon her. \n",
      "Princess Mary understood th is and appreciated his \n",
      "delicacy. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1727 of 2882 \n",
      "‘I am very, very grateful to you,’ she said in French, \n",
      "‘but I hope it was all a mi sunderstanding and that no one \n",
      "is to blame for it.’ She suddenly began to cry. \n",
      "‘Excuse me!’ she said. \n",
      "Rostov, knitting his brows, le ft the room with another \n",
      "low bow. War and Peace  \n",
      "1728 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XIV \n",
      "Well, is she pretty? Ah, friend- my pink one is \n",
      "delicious; her name is Dunyasha...’ \n",
      "But on glancing at Rostov’s face Ilyin stopped short. \n",
      "He saw that his hero and commander was following quite \n",
      "a different train of thought. \n",
      "Rostov glanced angrily at Ilyin and without replying \n",
      "strode off with rapid steps to the village. \n",
      "‘I’ll show them; I’ll give it to them, the brigands!’ said \n",
      "he to himself. \n",
      "Alpatych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to \n",
      "run, kept up with him with difficulty. \n",
      "‘What decision have you been pleased to come to?’ \n",
      "said he. \n",
      "Rostov stopped and, clenching his fists, suddenly and \n",
      "sternly turned on Alpatych. \n",
      "‘Decision? What decision? Old dotard!...’ cried he. \n",
      "‘What have you been about? Eh? The peasants are rioting, \n",
      "and you can’t manage them? You’re a traitor youself! I \n",
      "know you. I’ll flay you all alive! ...’ And as if afraid of \n",
      "wasting his store of anger, he left Alpatych and went \n",
      "rapidly forward. Alpatyc h, mastering his offended \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1729 of 2882 \n",
      "feelings, kept pace with Rostov at a gliding gait and \n",
      "continued to impart his views.  He said the peasants were \n",
      "obdurate and that at the pr esent moment it would be \n",
      "imprudent to ‘overresist’ them without an armed force, \n",
      "and would it not be better first to send for the military? \n",
      "‘I’ll give them armed force... I’ll ‘overresist’ them!’ \n",
      "uttered Rostov meaninglessly, breathless with irrational \n",
      "animal fury and the need to vent it. \n",
      "Without considering what he would do he moved \n",
      "unconciously with quick, resolute steps toward the crowd. \n",
      "And the nearer he drew to it the more Alpatych felt that \n",
      "this unreasonable action might produce good results. The \n",
      "peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they \n",
      "saw Rostov’s rapid, firm step s and resolute, frowning \n",
      "face. \n",
      "After the hussars had come to the village and Rostov \n",
      "had gone to see the princess, a certain confusion and \n",
      "dissension had arisen among the crowd. Some of the \n",
      "peasants said that these new arrivals were Russians and \n",
      "might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained. \n",
      "Dron was of this opinion, but as soon as he expressed it \n",
      "Karp and others attacked their ex-Elder. \n",
      "‘How many years have you been fattening on the \n",
      "commune?’ Karp shouted at him. ‘It’s all one to you! War and Peace  \n",
      "1730 of 2882 \n",
      "You’ll dig up your pot of mone y and take it away with \n",
      "you.... What does it matter to you whether our homes are \n",
      "ruined or not?’ \n",
      "‘We’ve been told to keep or der, and that no one is to \n",
      "leave their homes or take away  a single grain, and that’s \n",
      "all about it!’ cried another. \n",
      "‘It was your son’s turn to be  conscripted, but no fear! \n",
      "You begrudged your lump of a son,’ a little old man \n",
      "suddenly began attacking Dr on- ‘and so they took my \n",
      "Vanka to be shaved for a soldier! But we all have to die.’ \n",
      "‘To be sure, we all have to  die. I’m not against the \n",
      "commune,’ said Dron. \n",
      "‘That’s it- not against it! You’ve filled your belly...’ \n",
      "The two tall peasants had their say. As soon as Rostov, \n",
      "followed by Ilyin, Lavrushka, and Alpatych, came up to \n",
      "the crowd, Karp, thrusting his fingers into his belt and \n",
      "smiling a little, walked to th e front. Dron on the contrary \n",
      "retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer together. \n",
      "‘Who is your Elder here ? Hey?’ shouted Rostov, \n",
      "coming up to the crowd with quick steps. \n",
      "‘The Elder? What do you want with him?...’ asked \n",
      "Karp. \n",
      "But before the words were well out of his mouth, his \n",
      "cap flew off and a fierce blow jerked his head to one side. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1731 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Caps off, traitors!’ shout ed Rostov in a wrathful \n",
      "voice. ‘Where’s the Elder?’ he cried furiously. \n",
      "‘The Elder.... He wants the Elder!... Dron Zakharych, \n",
      "you!’ meek and flustered voices here and there were \n",
      "heard calling and caps began to come off their heads. \n",
      "‘We don’t riot, we’re following the orders,’ declared \n",
      "Karp, and at that moment se veral voices began speaking \n",
      "together. \n",
      "‘It’s as the old men have decided- there’s too many of \n",
      "you giving orders.’ \n",
      "‘Arguing? Mutiny!... Brigands! Traitors!’ cried Rostov \n",
      "unmeaningly in a voice not his own, gripping Karp by the \n",
      "collar. ‘Bind him, bind him !’ he shouted, though there \n",
      "was no one to bind him but Lavrushka and Alpatych. \n",
      "Lavrushka, however, ran up to Karp and seized him by \n",
      "the arms from behind. \n",
      "‘Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill?’ he \n",
      "called out. \n",
      "Alpatych turned to the p easants and ordered two of \n",
      "them by name to come and bind Karp. The men \n",
      "obediently came out of the crowd and began taking off \n",
      "their belts. \n",
      "‘Where’s the Elder?’ demanded Rostov in a loud \n",
      "voice. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1732 of 2882 \n",
      "With a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the \n",
      "crowd. \n",
      "‘Are you the Elder? Bind him, Lavrushka!’ shouted \n",
      "Rostov, as if that order, too, could not possibly meet with \n",
      "any opposition. \n",
      "And in fact two more p easants began binding Dron, \n",
      "who took off his own belt and hand ed it to them, as if to \n",
      "aid them. \n",
      "‘And you all listen to me!’ said Rostov to the peasants. \n",
      "‘Be off to your houses at onc e, and don’t let one of your \n",
      "voices be heard!’ \n",
      "‘Why, we’ve not done any harm! We did it just out of \n",
      "foolishness. It’s all nonsense... I said then that it was not \n",
      "in order,’ voices were heard bickering with one another. \n",
      "‘There! What did I say?’ sa id Alpatych, coming into \n",
      "his own again. ‘It’s wrong, lads!’ \n",
      "‘All our stupidity, Yakov Alpatych,’ came the answers, \n",
      "and the crowd began at onc e to disperse through the \n",

      "The two bound men were led off to the master’s house. \n",
      "The two drunken peasants followed them. \n",

      "1733 of 2882 \n",
      "Two hours later the carts were standing in the \n",
      "courtyard of the Bogucharovo house. The peasants were \n",

      "standing in the yard directing the men. \n",
      "‘Don’t put it in so carelessly,’ said one of the peasants, \n",

      "be done properly, according to  rule. Look here, put it \n",
      "under the bast matting and cover it with hay- that’s the \n",

      "‘Eh, books, books!’ said another peasant, bringing out \n",
      "Prince Andrew’s library cupboards. ‘Don’t catch up \n",
      "against it! It’s heavy, lads- solid books.’ \n",
      "‘Yes, they worked all day a nd didn’t play!’ remarked \n",

      "Unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess, Rostov \n",
      "did not go back to the house but  remained in the village \n",
      "awaiting her departure. When her carriage drove out of \n",
      "the house, he mounted and accompanied her eight miles War and Peace  \n",
      "1734 of 2882 \n",
      "from Bogucharovo to where the road was occupied by our \n",
      "troops. At the inn at Yankovo he respectfully took leave \n",
      "of her, for the first time permitting himself to kiss her \n",

      "‘How can you speak so!’ he blushingly replied to \n",

      "only peasants to fight, we s hould not have let the enemy \n",
      "come so far,’ said he with a sense of shame and wishing \n",

      "Princess. I wish you happine ss and consolation and hope \n",

      "But the princess, if she di d not again thank him in \n",

      "there she would have perish ed at the hands of the \n",

      "1743 of 2882 \n",
      "Since Prince Andrew had last seen him Kutuzov had \n",
      "grown still more corpulent,  flaccid, and fat. But the \n",

      "heavily and swayed limply on his brisk little horse. \n",
      "‘Whew... whew... whew!’ he whistled just audibly as \n",
      "he rode into the yard. His face expressed the relief of \n",
      "relaxed strain felt by a man who means to rest after a \n",
      "ceremony. He drew his left f oot out of the stirrup and, \n",
      "lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with \n",
      "the effort, raised it with difficulty onto the saddle, leaned \n",
      "on his knee, groaned, and slipped down into the arms of \n",
      "the Cossacks and adjutants who stood ready to assist him. \n",
      "He pulled himself together, looked round, screwing up \n",
      "his eyes, glanced at Prince Andrew, and, evidently not \n",
      "recognizing him, moved with  his waddling gait to the \n",
      "porch. ‘Whew... whew... whew!’ he whistled, and again \n",
      "glanced at Prince Andrew. As often occurs with old men, \n",
      "it was only after some seconds that the impression \n",

      "Kutuzov’s remembrance of his personality. \n",

      "1744 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Ah, how do you do, my dear prince? How do you do, \n",

      "‘May the kingdom of Heaven  be his! God’s will be \n",
      "done to us all!’ He sighed deeply, his whole chest \n",

      "released him Prince Andrew saw that Kutuzov’s flabby \n",
      "lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes. He \n",
      "sighed and pressed on the benc h with both hands to raise \n",
      "himself. \n",
      "‘Come! Come with me, we’ll have a talk,’ said he. \n",

      "1745 of 2882 \n",
      "But at that moment Denisov, no more intimidated by \n",
      "his superiors than by the en emy, came with jingling spurs \n",
      "up the steps of the porch, desp ite the angry whispers of \n",
      "the adjutants who tried to stop him. Kutuzov, his hands \n",
      "still pressed on the seat, glan ced at him glumly. Denisov, \n",
      "having given his name, annou nced that he had to \n",
      "communicate to his Serene Highness a matter of great \n",

      "annoyance, folded them acros s his stomach, repeating the \n",
      "words: ‘For our country’s welfare? Well, what is it? \n",
      "Speak!’ Denisov blushed like a gi rl (it was strange to see \n",
      "the color rise in that shaggy, bibulous, time-worn face) \n",
      "and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the \n",
      "enemy’s lines of communication between Smolensk and \n",
      "Vyazma. Denisov came from  those parts and knew the \n",
      "country well. His plan s eemed decidedly a good one, \n",
      "especially from the strength of conviction with which he \n",
      "spoke. Kutuzov looked down at his own legs, \n",
      "occasionally glancing at the door of the adjoining hut as if \n",
      "expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it. And \n",
      "from that hut, while Denisov was speaking, a general with \n",
      "a portfolio under his arm really did appear. War and Peace  \n",

      "explanations, ‘are you ready so soon?’ \n",
      "‘Ready, your Serene Highness,’ replied the general. \n",
      "Kutuzov swayed his head, as much as to say: ‘How is \n",
      "one man to deal with it all?’ and again listened to \n",
      "Denisov. \n",
      "‘I give my word of honor as a Wussian officer,’ said \n",
      "Denisov, ‘that I can bw eak Napoleon’s line of \n",
      "communication!’ \n",
      "‘What relation are you to Intendant General Kiril \n",
      "Andreevich Denisov?’ asked Kutuzov, interrupting him. \n",
      "‘He is my uncle, your Sewene Highness.’ \n",
      "‘Ah, we were friends,’ said  Kutuzov cheerfully. ‘All \n",
      "right, all right, friend, stay he re at the staff and tomorrow \n",
      "we’ll have a talk.’ \n",
      "With a nod to Denisov he turned away and put out his \n",
      "hand for the papers Konovnitsyn had brought him. \n",
      "‘Would not your Serene Highness like to come \n",
      "inside?’ said the general on duty in a discontented voice, \n",
      "‘the plans must be examined and several papers have to \n",
      "be signed.’ \n",
      "An adjutant came out and announced that everything \n",
      "was in readiness within. But Kutuzov evidently did not \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1747 of 2882 \n",
      "wish to enter that room till he was disengaged. He made a \n",
      "grimace... \n",
      "‘No, tell them to bring a small table out here, my dear \n",
      "boy. I’ll look at them here,’ said he. ‘Don’t go away,’ he \n",
      "added, turning to Prince A ndrew, who remained in the \n",
      "porch and listened to the general’s report. \n",
      "While this was being given, Prince Andrew heard the \n",
      "whisper of a woman’s voice and the rustle of a silk dress \n",
      "behind the door. Several times on glancing that way he \n",
      "noticed behind that door a plump, rosy, handsome woman \n",
      "in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head, \n",
      "holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the \n",
      "commander in chief. Kutiizov’s adjutant whispered to \n",
      "Prince Andrew that this was the wife of the priest whose \n",
      "home it was, and that she in tended to offer his Serene \n",
      "Highness bread and salt. ‘Her husband has welcomed his \n",
      "Serene Highness with the cr oss at the church, and she \n",
      "intends to welcome him in the house.... She’s very pretty,’ \n",
      "added the adjutant with a smile. At those words Kutuzov \n",
      "looked round. He was listeni ng to the general’s report- \n",
      "which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at \n",
      "Tsarevo-Zaymishche- as he had listened to Denisov, and \n",
      "seven years previously had li stened to the discussion at \n",
      "the Austerlitz council of war. He evidently listened only War and Peace  \n",
      "1748 of 2882 \n",
      "because he had ears which, though there was a piece of \n",
      "tow in one of them, could not  help hearing; but it was \n",
      "evident that nothing the genera l could say would surprise \n",
      "or even interest him, that he knew all that would be said \n",
      "beforehand, and heard it all only because he had to, as one \n",
      "has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer. All that \n",
      "Denisov had said was clever and to the point. What the \n",
      "general was saying was even more clever and to the point, \n",
      "but it was evident that Kutuzov despised knowledge and \n",
      "cleverness, and knew of something else that would decide \n",
      "the matter- something independent of clever. ness and \n",
      "knowledge. Prince Andrew watched the commander in \n",
      "chief’s face attentively, and the only expression he could \n",
      "see there was one of boredom, curiosity as to the meaning \n",
      "of the feminine whispering behind the door, and a desire \n",
      "to observe propriety. It was evident that Kutuzov despised \n",
      "cleverness and learning and even the patriotic feeling \n",
      "shown by Denisov, but despised  them not because of his \n",
      "own intellect, feelings, or know ledge- he did not try to \n",
      "display any of these- but because of something else. He \n",
      "despised them because of his old age and experience of \n",
      "life. The only instruction Kutuzov gave of his own accord \n",
      "during that report referred to looting by the Russian \n",
      "troops. At the end of the report the general put before him \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1749 of 2882 \n",
      "for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment \n",
      "from army commanders for green oats mown down by the \n",
      "soldiers, when landowners lodged petitions for \n",
      "compensation. \n",
      "After hearing the matter, Kutuzov smacked his lips \n",
      "together and shook his head. \n",
      "‘Into the stove... into the fire with it! I tell you once for \n",
      "all, my dear fellow,’ said he, ‘into the fire with all such \n",

      "folds in his fat white neck he moved toward the door with \n",
      "a more cheerful expression. \n",
      "The priest’s wife, flushing rosy red, caught up the dish \n",
      "she had after all not manage d to present at the right \n",
      "moment, though she had so long been preparing for it, and \n",
      "with a low bow offered it to Kutuzov. \n",
      "He screwed up his eyes, smiled, lifted her chin with his \n",

      "‘Ah, what a beauty! Thank you, sweetheart!’ \n",

      "The adjutant came out to the porch and asked Prince \n",
      "Andrew to lunch with him. Half an hour later Prince \n",

      "‘I am sorry, for I need you. But you’re right, you’re \n",
      "right! It’s not here that me n are needed. Advisers are \n",

      "Taking his hand and dr awing him downwards, \n",

      "the subject, Kutuzov began to  speak of the Turkish war \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1753 of 2882 \n",
      "and the peace that had been concluded. ‘Yes, I have been \n",

      "‘advisers’ which evidently occupied him. ‘Ah, those \n",
      "advisers!’ said he. ‘If we had listened to them all we \n",
      "should not have made peace with Turkey and should not \n",
      "have been through with that wa r. Everything in haste, but \n",
      "more haste, less speed. Kamenski would have been lost if \n",
      "he had not died. He storme d fortresses with thirty \n",
      "thousand men. It is not difficult to capture a fortress but it \n",

      "attacking but patience and time are wanted. Kamenski \n",
      "sent soldiers to Rustchuk, but I only employed these two \n",

      "equally clear to Kutuzov that by accepting battle and \n",
      "risking the loss of a quarter  of his army he would \n",

      "The Russian army, they say, in its retreat from \n",
      "Smolensk sought out for itself the best position for a War and Peace  \n",
      "1778 of 2882 \n",
      "general engagement and found such a position at \n",
      "Borodino. \n",
      "The Russians, they say, fortified this position in \n",

      "In front of this position, they say, a fortified outpost \n",
      "was set up on the Shevardi no mound to observe the \n",

      "attacked this advanced post and took it, and, on the \n",
      "twenty-sixth, attacked the whole Russian army, which \n",
      "was in position on the field of Borodino. \n",
      "So the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, as anyone \n",
      "who cares to look into the matter can easily convince \n",
      "himself. \n",
      "The Russians did not seek out the best position but, on \n",
      "the contrary, during the retreat passed many positions \n",
      "better than Borodino. They di d not stop at any one of \n",
      "these positions because Kutuzov did not wish to occupy a \n",
      "position he had not himself chosen, because the popular \n",
      "demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly \n",
      "enough, and because Miloradovich had not yet arrived \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1779 of 2882 \n",
      "that other positions they had passed were stronger, and \n",
      "that the position at Borodino (the one where the battle was \n",
      "fought), far from being strong, was no more a position \n",
      "than any other spot one might find in the Russian Empire \n",
      "by sticking a pin into the map at hazard. \n",
      "Not only did the Russians not fortify the position on \n",

      "the highroad (that is, the positi on on which the battle took \n",
      "place), but never till the twen ty-fifth of August, 1812, did \n",
      "they think that a battle might  be fought there. This was \n",
      "shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments \n",
      "there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the \n",
      "twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were not completed, and \n",
      "secondly, by the position of the Shevardino Redoubt. That \n",
      "redoubt was quite senseless in front of the position where \n",
      "the battle was accepted. Why was it more strongly \n",
      "fortified than any other post? And why were all efforts \n",
      "exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till \n",
      "late at night on the twenty -fourth? A Cossack patrol \n",
      "would have sufficed to observe the enemy. Thirdly, as \n",
      "proof that the position on wh ich the battle was fought had \n",
      "not been foreseen and that  the Shevardino Redoubt was \n",
      "not an advanced post of that position, we have the fact \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1780 of 2882 \n",
      "were convinced that the Sh evardino Redoubt was the left \n",

      "report, written in hot haste after the battle, speaks of the \n",
      "Shevardino Redoubt as the left  flank of the position. It \n",
      "was much later, when reports  on the battle of Borodino \n",

      "Russian side) and transferre d it to the plain between \n",
      "Utitsa, Semenovsk, and Borodino- a plain no more \n",

      "that case we should pr obably have defended the \n",

      "twenty-fifth, in the position we intended and had fortified. \n",
      "But as the attack on our left flank took place in the \n",
      "evening after the retreat of  our rea guard (that is, \n",
      "immediately after the fight at Gridneva), and as the \n",

      "After the loss of the Shevardino Redoubt, we found \n",
      "ourselves on the morning of the twenty-fifth without a \n",
      "position for our left flank, and were forced to bend it back \n",
      "and hastily entrench it where it chanced to be. \n",
      "Not only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth \n",
      "defended by weak, unfinished entrenchments, but the \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",

      "left flank and the shifting of the whole field of the \n",
      "forthcoming battle from right to left- maintained their \n",
      "extended position from the village of Novoe to Utitsa, and \n",
      "consequently had to move their forces from right to left \n",
      "during the battle. So it ha ppened that throughout the \n",

      "(Poniatowski’s action against Utitsa, and Uvarov’s on the \n",
      "right flank against the French, were actions distinct from \n",
      "the main course of the battle.)  So the battle of Borodino \n",
      "did not take place at all as (in an effort to conceal our \n",
      "commanders’ mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the \n",
      "glory due to the Russian army and people) it has been \n",

      "chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly \n",
      "weaker than those of the enemy, but, as a result of the loss \n",
      "of the Shevardino Redoubt, th e Russians fought the battle \n",

      "position, with forces only half as numerous as the French; \n",
      "that is to say, under conditions in which it was not merely \n",

      "CHAPTER XX \n",
      "On the morning of the twenty-fifth Pierre was leaving \n",
      "Mozhaysk. At the descent of the high steep hill, down \n",
      "which a winding road led out of the town past the \n",
      "cathedral on the right, where a service was being held and \n",
      "the bells were ringing, Pierre  got out of his vehicle and \n",
      "proceeded on foot. Behind him a cavalry regiment was \n",
      "coming down the hill preceded by its singers. Coming up \n",
      "toward him was a train of carts carrying men who had \n",
      "been wounded in the engagement the day before. The \n",
      "peasant drivers, shouting and lashing their horses, kept \n",
      "crossing from side to side. The carts, in each of which \n",
      "three or four wounded soldiers were lying or sitting, jolted \n",
      "over the stones that had been thrown on the steep incline \n",
      "to make it something like a road. The wounded, bandaged \n",
      "with rags, with pale cheeks, compressed lips, and knitted \n",
      "brows, held on to the sides of the carts as they were jolted \n",
      "against one another. Almost all of them stared with naive, \n",
      "childlike curiosity at Pie rre’s white hat and green \n",
      "swallow-tail coat. \n",
      "Pierre’s coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of \n",
      "wounded to keep to one side of the road. The cavalry \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1785 of 2882 \n",
      "regiment, as it descended the hill with its singers, \n",
      "surrounded Pierre’s carriage and blocked the road. Pierre \n",
      "stopped, being pressed against th e side of the cutting in \n",
      "which the road ran. The suns hine from behind the hill did \n",
      "not penetrate into the cutting and there it was cold and \n",
      "damp, but above Pierre’s head was the bright August \n",
      "sunshine and the bells sounde d merrily. One of the carts \n",
      "with wounded stopped by the side  of the road close to \n",
      "Pierre. The driver in his bast  shoes ran panting up to it, \n",
      "placed a stone under one of its tireless hind wheels, and \n",
      "began arranging the breech-band on his little horse. \n",
      "One of the wounded, an old soldier with a bandaged \n",
      "arm who was following the cart on foot, caught hold of it \n",
      "with his sound hand and turned to look at Pierre. \n",
      "‘I say, fellow countryman! Will they set us down here \n",
      "or take us on to Moscow?’ he asked. \n",
      "Pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the \n",
      "question. He was looking now at the cavalry regiment that \n",
      "had met the convoy of wounded, now at the cart by which \n",
      "he was standing, in which tw o wounded men were sitting \n",
      "and one was lying. One of thos e sitting up in the cart had \n",
      "probably been wounded in the cheek. His whole head was \n",
      "wrapped in rags and one cheek was swollen to the size of \n",
      "a baby’s head. His nose and mouth were twisted to one War and Peace  \n",
      "1786 of 2882 \n",
      "side. This soldier was looking at the cathedral and \n",
      "crossing himself. Another, a young lad, a fair-haired \n",
      "recruit as white as though th ere was no blood in his thin \n",
      "face, looked at Pierre kindly, with a fixed smile. The third \n",
      "lay prone so that his face was not visible. The cavalry \n",
      "singers were passing close by: \n",
      "Ah lost, quite lost... is my head so keen, \n",
      "Living in a foreign land. \n",
      "they sang their soldiers’ dance song. \n",
      "As if responding to them but with a different sort of \n",
      "merriment, the metallic sound of the bells reverberated \n",
      "high above and the hot rays of  the sun bathed the top of \n",
      "the opposite slope with yet anot her sort of merriment. But \n",
      "beneath the slope, by the cart  with the wounded near the \n",
      "panting little nag where Pierre stood, it was damp, \n",
      "somber, and sad. \n",
      "The soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at \n",
      "the cavalry singers. \n",
      "‘Oh, the coxcombs!’ he muttered reproachfully. \n",
      "‘It’s not the soldiers only, but I’ve seen peasants today, \n",
      "too.... The peasants- even they  have to go,’ said the \n",
      "soldier behind the cart, addressing Pierre with a sad smile. \n",
      "‘No distinctions made nowadays.... They want the whole \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1787 of 2882 \n",
      "nation to fall on them- in a word, it’s Moscow! They want \n",
      "to make an end of it.’ \n",
      "In spite of the obscurity of the soldier’s words Pierre \n",
      "understood what he wanted to say and nodded approval. \n",
      "The road was clear again; Pierre descended the hill and \n",
      "drove on. \n",
      "He kept looking to either side of the road for familiar \n",
      "faces, but only saw everywhe re the unfamiliar faces of \n",
      "various military men of different branches of the service, \n",
      "who all looked with astonish ment at his white hat and \n",
      "green tail coat. \n",
      "Having gone nearly three miles he at last met an \n",
      "acquaintance and eagerly addressed him. This was one of \n",
      "the head army doctors. He was driving toward Pierre in a \n",
      "covered gig, sitting beside a young surgeon, and on \n",
      "recognizing Pierre he told the Cossack who occupied the \n",
      "driver’s seat to pull up. \n",
      "‘Count! Your excellency, how  come you to be here?’ \n",
      "asked the doctor. \n",
      "‘Well, you know, I wanted to see..’ \n",
      "‘Yes, yes, there will be something to see...’ \n",
      "Pierre got out and talked to  the doctor, explaining his \n",
      "intention of taking part in a battle. \n",
      "The doctor advised him to apply direct to Kutuzov. War and Peace  \n",
      "1788 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Why should you be God knows where out of sight, \n",
      "during the battle?’ he said, exchanging glances with his \n",
      "young companion. ‘Anyhow his Serene Highness knows \n",
      "you and will receive you grac iously. That’s what you \n",
      "must do.’ \n",
      "The doctor seemed tired and in a hurry. \n",
      "‘You think so?... Ah, I also  wanted to ask you where \n",
      "our position is exactly?’ said Pierre. \n",
      "‘The position?’ repeated the doctor. ‘Well, that’s not \n",
      "my line. Drive past Tatarinova, a lot of digging is going \n",
      "on there. Go up the hillock and you’ll see.’ \n",
      "‘Can one see from there?... If you would..’ \n",
      "But the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his \n",
      "gig. \n",
      "‘I would go with you but on my honor I’m up to here’- \n",
      "and he pointed to his thro at. ‘I’m galloping to the \n",
      "commander of the corps. How do matters stand?... You \n",
      "know, Count, there’ll be a ba ttle tomorrow. Out of an \n",
      "army of a hundred thousand we must expect at least \n",
      "twenty thousand wounded, and we haven’t stretchers, or \n",
      "bunks, or dressers, or docto rs enough for six thousand. \n",
      "We have ten thousand carts, but  we need other things as \n",
      "well- we must manage as best we can!’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1789 of 2882 \n",
      "The strange thought that of  the thousands of men, \n",
      "young and old, who had stared with merry surprise at his \n",
      "hat (perhaps the very men he had noticed), twenty \n",
      "thousand were inevitably doom ed to wounds and death \n",
      "amazed Pierre. \n",
      "‘They may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of \n",
      "anything but death?’ And by some latent sequence of \n",
      "thought the descent of the Mozhaysk hill, the carts with \n",
      "the wounded, the ringing bells, the slanting rays of the \n",
      "sun, and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to \n",
      "his mind. \n",
      "‘The cavalry ride to bat tle and meet the wounded and \n",
      "do not for a moment think of what awaits them, but pass \n",
      "by, winking at the wounded. Yet from among these men \n",
      "twenty thousand are doomed to  die, and they wonder at \n",
      "my hat! Strange!’ thought Pi erre, continuing his way to \n",
      "Tatarinova. \n",
      "In front of a landowner’s house to the left of the road \n",
      "stood carriages, wagons, and crowds of orderlies and \n",
      "sentinels. The commander in chief was putting up there, \n",
      "but just when Pierre arrived he was not in and hardly any \n",
      "of the staff were there- they had gone to the church \n",
      "service. Pierre drove on toward Gorki. War and Peace  \n",
      "1790 of 2882 \n",
      "When he had ascended the hill and reached the little \n",
      "village street, he saw for the first time peasant militiamen \n",
      "in their white shirts and with  crosses on their caps, who, \n",
      "talking and laughing loudly, animated and perspiring, \n",
      "were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the \n",
      "right of the road. \n",
      "Some of them were digging, others were wheeling \n",
      "barrowloads of earth along pl anks, while others stood \n",
      "about doing nothing. \n",
      "Two officers were standing on the knoll, directing the \n",
      "men. On seeing these peasants, who were evidently still \n",
      "amused by the novelty of their position as soldiers, Pierre \n",
      "once more thought of the wounded men at Mozhaysk and \n",
      "understood what the soldier had meant when he said: \n",
      "‘They want the whole nation to fall on them.’ The sight of \n",
      "these bearded peasants at work on the battlefield, with \n",
      "their queer, clumsy boots and perspiring necks, and their \n",
      "shirts opening from the le ft toward the middle, \n",
      "unfastened, exposing thei r sunburned collarbones, \n",
      "impressed Pierre more strongly with the solemnity and \n",
      "importance of the moment than anything he had yet seen \n",
      "or heard. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1791 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XXI \n",
      "Pierre stepped out of his carriage and, passing the \n",
      "toiling militiamen, ascended the knoll from which, \n",
      "according to the doctor, the battlefield could be seen. \n",
      "It was about eleven o’cloc k. The sun shone somewhat \n",
      "to the left and behind hi m and brightly lit up the \n",
      "enormous panorama which, risi ng like an amphitheater, \n",
      "extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere. \n",
      "From above on the left, bisecting that amphitheater, \n",
      "wound the Smolensk highroad, passing through a village \n",
      "with a white church some five hundred paces in front of \n",
      "the knoll and below it. This was Borodino. Below the \n",
      "village the road crossed the river by a bridge and, winding \n",
      "down and up, rose higher and higher to the village of \n",
      "Valuevo visible about four miles away, where Napoleon \n",
      "was then stationed. Beyond Valuevo the road disappeared \n",
      "into a yellowing forest on the horizon. Far in the distance \n",
      "in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road, the \n",
      "cross and belfry of the Kolocha Monastery gleamed in the \n",
      "sun. Here and there over the whole of that blue expanse, \n",
      "to right and left of the fo rest and the road, smoking \n",
      "campfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops- \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1792 of 2882 \n",
      "ours and the enemy’s. The ground to the right- along the \n",
      "course of the Kolocha and Moskva rivers- was broken and \n",
      "hilly. Between the hollows the villages of Bezubova and \n",
      "Zakharino showed in the distan ce. On the left the ground \n",
      "was more level; there were  fields of grain, and the \n",
      "smoking ruins of Semenovsk, which had been burned \n",
      "down, could be seen. \n",
      "All that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the \n",
      "left nor the right side of the field fully satisfied his \n",
      "expectations. Nowhere could he  see the battlefield he had \n",
      "expected to find, but only fields, meadows, troops, woods, \n",
      "the smoke of campfires, villages, mounds, and streams; \n",
      "and try as he would he could descry no military ‘position’ \n",
      "in this place which teemed w ith life, nor could he even \n",
      "distinguish our troops from the enemy’s. \n",
      "‘I must ask someone who knows,’ he thought, and \n",
      "addressed an officer who was looking with curiosity at his \n",
      "huge unmilitary figure. \n",
      "‘May I ask you,’ said Pierre, ‘what village that is in \n",
      "front?’ \n",
      "‘Burdino, isn’t it?’ said th e officer, turning to his \n",
      "companion. \n",
      "‘Borodino,’ the other corrected him. \n",

      "1793 of 2882 \n",
      "The officer, evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk, \n",
      "moved up to Pierre. \n",
      "‘Are those our men there?’ Pierre inquired. \n",
      "‘Yes, and there, further on, are the French,’ said the \n",
      "officer. ‘There they are, there... you can see them.’ \n",
      "‘Where? Where?’ asked Pierre. \n",
      "‘One can see them with the naked eye... Why, there!’ \n",
      "The officer pointed with hi s hand to the smoke visible \n",
      "on the left beyond the river,  and the same stern and \n",
      "serious expression that Pierre  had noticed on many of the \n",
      "faces he had met came into his face. \n",
      "‘Ah, those are the French! And over there?...’ Pierre \n",
      "pointed to a knoll on the le ft, near which some troops \n",
      "could be seen. \n",
      "‘Those are ours.’ \n",
      "‘Ah, ours! And there?...’ Pi erre pointed to another \n",
      "knoll in the distance with a bi g tree on it, near a village \n",
      "that lay in a hollow where also some campfires were \n",
      "smoking and something black was visible. \n",
      "‘That’s his again,’ said the officer. (It was the \n",
      "Shevardino Redoubt.) ‘It was ours yesterday, but now it is \n",
      "his.’ \n",
      "‘Then how about our position?’ War and Peace  \n",
      "1794 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Our position?’ replied the officer with a smile of \n",
      "satisfaction. ‘I can tell you quite clearly, because I \n",
      "constructed nearly all our en trenchments. There, you see? \n",
      "There’s our center, at Bor odino, just there,’ and he \n",
      "pointed to the village in front of them with the white \n",
      "church. ‘That’s where one crosses the Kolocha. You see \n",
      "down there where the rows of hay are lying in the hollow, \n",
      "there’s the bridge. That’s our  center. Our right flank is \n",
      "over there’- he pointed sharpl y to the right, far away in \n",
      "the broken ground- ‘That’s wh ere the Moskva River is, \n",
      "and we have thrown up three redoubts there, very strong \n",
      "ones. The left flank...’ here the officer paused. ‘Well, you \n",
      "see, that’s difficult to explain.... Yesterday our left flank \n",
      "was there at Shevardino, you see, where the oak is, but \n",
      "now we have withdrawn our left wing- now it is over \n",
      "there, do you see that village and the smoke? That’s \n",
      "Semenovsk, yes, there,’ he pointed to Raevski’s knoll. \n",
      "‘But the battle will hardly be there. His having moved his \n",
      "troops there is only a ruse; he  will probably pass round to \n",
      "the right of the Moskva. But wherever it may be, many a \n",
      "man will be missing tomorrow!’ he remarked. \n",
      "An elderly sergeant who had approached the officer \n",
      "while he was giving these e xplanations had waited in \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1795 of 2882 \n",
      "silence for him to finish sp eaking, but at this point, \n",
      "evidently not liking the officer’s remark, interrupted him. \n",
      "‘Gabions must be sent for,’ said he sternly. \n",
      "The officer appeared abashed, as though he understood \n",
      "that one might think of how  many men would be missing \n",
      "tomorrow but ought not to speak to speak of it. \n",
      "‘Well, send number three co mpany again,’ the officer \n",
      "replied hurriedly. \n",
      "‘And you, are you one of the doctors?’ \n",
      "‘No, I’ve come on my own,’ answered Pierre, and he \n",
      "went down the hill again, passing the militiamen. \n",
      "‘Oh, those damned fellows!’ muttered the officer who \n",
      "followed him, holding his nose as  he ran past the men at \n",
      "work. \n",
      "‘There they are... bringi ng her, coming... There they \n",
      "are... They’ll be here in a minute...’ voices were suddenly \n",
      "heard saying; and officers, soldiers, and militiamen began \n",
      "running forward along the road. \n",
      "A church procession was coming up the hill from \n",
      "Borodino. First along the dusty road came the infantry in \n",
      "ranks, bareheaded and with arms reversed. From behind \n",
      "them came the sound of church singing. \n",
      "Soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past Pierre \n",
      "toward the procession. War and Peace  \n",
      "1796 of 2882 \n",
      "‘They are bringing her, our Protectress!... The Iberian \n",
      "Mother of God!’ someone cried. \n",

      "The militiamen, both those who had been in the village \n",

      "and officers bore a large, dark-faced icon with an \n",

      "Behind, before, and on both sides, crowds of militiamen \n",
      "with bared heads walked, ran, and bowed to the ground. \n",
      "At the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon; \n",
      "the men who had been holding it up by the linen bands \n",
      "attached to it were relieved by others, the chanters relit \n",
      "their censers, and service began. The hot rays of the sun \n",
      "beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with the \n",
      "hair of the bared heads a nd with the ribbons decorating \n",
      "the icon. The singing did not  sound loud under the open \n",
      "sky. An immense crowd of bareheaded officers, soldiers, \n",
      "and militiamen surrounded the icon. Behind the priest and \n",
      "a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot reserved for \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1797 of 2882 \n",
      "them. A bald general with ge neral with a St. George’s \n",
      "Cross on his neck stood just be hind the priest’s back, and \n",
      "without crossing himself (h e was evidently a German) \n",
      "patiently awaited the end of the service, which he \n",
      "considered it necessary to hear to the end, probably to \n",
      "arouse the patriotism of th e Russian people. Another \n",
      "general stood in a martial pose, crossing himself by \n",
      "shaking his hand in front of his chest while looking about \n",
      "him. Standing among the crow d of peasants, Pierre \n",
      "recognized several acquaint ances among these notables, \n",
      "but did not look at them- his whole attention was \n",
      "absorbed in watching the serious expression on the faces \n",
      "of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were all \n",
      "gazing eagerly at the icon. As soon as the tired chanters, \n",
      "who were singing the service for the twentieth time that \n",
      "day, began lazily and mechanically to sing: ‘Save from \n",
      "calamity Thy servants, O Mother  of God,’ and the priest \n",
      "and deacon chimed in: ‘For to Thee under God we all flee \n",
      "as to an inviolable bulwark  and protection,’ there again \n",
      "kindled in all those faces the same expression of \n",
      "consciousness of the solemnity of the impending moment \n",
      "that Pierre had seen on the faces  at the foot of the hill at \n",
      "Mozhaysk and momentarily on many and many faces he \n",
      "had met that morning; and heads were bowed more War and Peace  \n",
      "1798 of 2882 \n",
      "frequently and hair tossed back, and sighs and the sound \n",
      "men made as they crossed themselves were heard. \n",
      "The crowd round the icon s uddenly parted and pressed \n",
      "against Pierre. Someone, a very important personage \n",
      "judging by the haste with which way was made for him, \n",
      "was approaching the icon. \n",
      "It was Kutuzov, who had been riding round the \n",
      "position and on his way back to Tatarinova had stopped \n",
      "where the service was being he ld. Pierre recognized him \n",
      "at once by his peculiar figure,  which distinguished him \n",
      "from everybody else. \n",
      "With a long overcoat on his his exceedingly stout, \n",
      "round-shouldered body, with unc overed white head and \n",
      "puffy face showing the white ball of the eye he had lost, \n",
      "Kutuzov walked with plunging, swaying gait into the \n",
      "crowd and stopped behind the priest. He crossed himself \n",
      "with an accustomed movement, bent till he touched the \n",
      "ground with his hand, and bowed his white head with a \n",
      "deep sigh. Behind Kutuzov was Bennigsen and the suite. \n",
      "Despite the presence of the commander in chief, who \n",
      "attracted the attention of a ll the superior officers, the \n",
      "militiamen and soldiers conti nued their prayers without \n",

      "1799 of 2882 \n",
      "When the service was over, Kutuzov stepped up to the \n",

      "for a long time tried vainly to rise, but could not do so on \n",
      "account of his weakness and weight. His white head \n",
      "twitched with the effort. At last he rose, kissed the icon as \n",
      "a child does with naively pouting lips, and again bowed \n",
      "till he touched the ground with his hand. The other \n",
      "generals followed his example, then the officers, and after \n",
      "them with excited faces, pressing on one another, \n",

      "Staggering amid the crush, Pierre looked about him. \n",
      "‘Count Peter Kirilovich! How did you get here?’ said a \n",
      "voice. \n",
      "Pierre looked round. Boris Drubetskoy, brushing his \n",
      "knees with his hand  (he had probably soiled them when \n",
      "he, too, had knelt before the icon), came up to him \n",
      "smiling. Boris was elegantly dressed, with a slightly \n",
      "martial touch appropriate to a campaign. He wore a long \n",
      "coat and like Kutuzov had a whip slung across his \n",
      "shoulder. \n",
      "Meanwhile Kutuzov had reached the village and seated \n",
      "himself in the shade of the nearest house, on a bench \n",
      "which one Cossack had run to fetch and another had \n",
      "hastily covered with a rug. An immense and brilliant suite \n",
      "surrounded him. \n",
      "The icon was carried further, accompanied by the \n",

      "talking to Boris. \n",
      "He explained his wish to be present at the battle and to \n",
      "see the position. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1801 of 2882 \n",
      "‘This is what you must do,’ said Boris. ‘I will do the \n",
      "honors of the camp to you. You will see everything best \n",
      "from where Count Bennigsen will be. I am in attendance \n",
      "on him, you know; I’ll mention it to him. But if you want \n",
      "to ride round the position, come along with us. We are \n",
      "just going to the left flank. Then when we get back, do \n",
      "spend the night with me and we’ll arrange a game of \n",
      "cards. Of course you know Dm itri Sergeevich? Those are \n",
      "his quarters,’ and he pointed to the third house in the \n",
      "village of Gorki. \n",
      "‘But I should like to see the right flank. They say it’s \n",
      "very strong,’ said Pierre. ‘I s hould like to start from the \n",
      "Moskva River and ride round the whole position.’ \n",
      "‘Well, you can do that later, but the chief thing is the \n",
      "left flank.’ \n",
      "‘Yes, yes. But where is Prince Bolkonski’s regiment? \n",
      "Can you point it out to me?’ \n",
      "‘Prince Andrew’s? We shall pass it and I’ll take you to \n",

      "What about the left flank?’ asked Pierre \n",
      "‘To tell you the truth, between ourselves, God only \n",
      "knows what state our left flank is in,’ said Boris \n",
      "confidentially lowering his voice. ‘It is not at all what \n",
      "Count Bennigsen intended. He meant to fortify that knoll War and Peace  \n",
      "1802 of 2882 \n",
      "quite differently, but...’ Boris shrugged his shoulders, ‘his \n",
      "Serene Highness would not have it, or someone persuaded \n",
      "him. You see...’ but Boris di d not finish, for at that \n",
      "moment Kaysarov, Kutuzov’s adjutant, came up to Pierre. \n",

      "Highness could so the intentions of the French!’ \n",
      "‘You mean the left flank?’ asked Kaysarov. \n",
      "‘Yes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely strong.’ \n",
      "Though Kutuzov had dismissed all unnecessary men \n",
      "from the staff, Boris had contrived to remain at \n",
      "headquarters after the cha nges. He had established \n",
      "himself with Count Bennigsen, who, like all on whom \n",
      "Boris had been in attendan ce, considered young Prince \n",
      "Drubetskoy an invaluable man. \n",
      "In the higher command ther e were two sharply defined \n",
      "parties: Kutuzov’s party and that of Bennigsen, the chief \n",
      "of staff. Boris belonged to  the latter and no one else, \n",
      "while showing servile respect to Kutuzov, could so create \n",
      "an impression that the old fellow was not much good and \n",
      "that Bennigsen managed everything. Now the decisive \n",
      "moment of battle had come when Kutuzov would be \n",
      "destroyed and the power pass to Bennigsen, or even if \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1803 of 2882 \n",
      "Kutuzov won the battle it w ould be felt that everything \n",
      "was done by Bennigsen. In any case many great rewards \n",
      "would have to be given for tomorrow’s action, and new \n",
      "men would come to the front. So Boris was full of \n",
      "nervous vivacity all day. \n",
      "After Kaysarov, others whom Pierre knew came up to \n",
      "him, and he had not time to reply to all the questions \n",
      "about Moscow that were show ered upon him, or to listen \n",
      "to all that was told him. The faces all expressed animation \n",
      "and apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that the cause of \n",
      "the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in \n",
      "questions of personal success; his mind, however, was \n",
      "occupied by the different expression he saw on other \n",
      "faces- an expression that s poke not of personal matters \n",
      "but of the universal questions of life and death. Kutuzov \n",
      "noticed Pierre’s figure and the group gathered round him. \n",
      "‘Call him to me,’ said Kutuzov. \n",
      "An adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highness’ wish, \n",
      "and Pierre went toward Kutuzov’s bench. But a \n",
      "militiaman got there before him. It was Dolokhov. \n",
      "‘How did that fellow get here?’ asked Pierre. \n",
      "‘He’s a creature that wriggl es in anywhere!’ was the \n",
      "answer. ‘He has been degraded, you know. Now he wants \n",
      "to bob up again. He’s been proposing some scheme or \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1804 of 2882 \n",
      "other and has crawled into th e enemy’s picket line at \n",
      "night.... He’s a brave fellow.’ \n",
      "Pierre took off his hat a nd bowed respectfully to \n",
      "Kutuzov. \n",
      "‘I concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness \n",
      "you might send me away or say that you knew what I was \n",
      "reporting, but then I shoul dn&#x2019;t lose anything...’ \n",

      "may prove useful to your Serene Highness.’ \n",
      "‘Yes... Yes...’ Kutuzov repeated, his laughing eye \n",
      "narrowing more and more as he looked at Pierre. \n",
      "Just then Boris, with his courtierlike adroitness, \n",
      "stepped up to Pierre’s side near Kutuzov and in a most \n",
      "natural manner, without raisi ng his voice, said to Pierre, \n",
      "as though continuing an interrupted conversation: \n",
      "‘The militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready \n",
      "to die. What heroism, Count!’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1805 of 2882 \n",
      "Boris evidently said this to Pierre in order to be \n",
      "overheard by his Serene Highness. He knew Kutuzov’s \n",
      "attention would be caught by those words, and so it was. \n",
      "‘What are you saying about the militia?’ he asked \n",
      "Boris. \n",
      "‘Preparing for tomorrow, your Serene Highness- for \n",
      "death- they have put on clean shirts.’ \n",
      "‘Ah... a wonderful, a matchless people!’ said Kutuzov; \n",
      "and he closed his eyes and swayed his head. ‘A matchless \n",
      "people!’ he repeated with a sigh. \n",
      "‘So you want to smell gunpowde r?’ he said to Pierre. \n",
      "‘Yes, it’s a pleasant smell. I have the honor to be one of \n",
      "your wife’s adorers. Is she well? My quarters are at your \n",
      "service.’ \n",
      "And as often happens with old people, Kutuzov began \n",
      "looking about absent-mindedly as if forgetting all he \n",
      "wanted to say or do. \n",
      "Then, evidently remembering what he wanted, he \n",
      "beckoned to Andrew Kaysarov, his adjutant’s brother. \n",
      "‘Those verses... those verses of Marin’s... how do they \n",
      "go, eh? Those he wrote about Gerakov: ‘Lectures for the \n",
      "corps inditing’... Recite them, recite them!’ said he, \n",
      "evidently preparing to laugh. War and Peace  \n",
      "1806 of 2882 \n",
      "Kaysarov recited.... Kutuzov smilingly nodded his \n",
      "head to the rhythm of the verses. \n",
      "When Pierre had left Kutuzov, Dolokhov came up to \n",
      "him and took his hand. \n",
      "‘I am very glad to meet you here, Count,’ he said \n",
      "aloud, regardless of the presen ce of strangers and in a \n",

      "I am glad of this opportunity to tell you that I regret the \n",

      "and where rows of fragrant new-mown hay lay by the \n",
      "riverside. They rode across that bridge into the village of \n",
      "Borodino and thence turned to the left, passing an \n",
      "enormous number of troops and guns, and came to a high \n",
      "knoll where militiamen were digging. This was the \n",
      "redoubt, as yet unnamed, which afterwards became \n",

      "the day before and where several horsemen could be \n",
      "descried. The officers said that either Napoleon or Murat \n",

      "the essential points of the impending battle, but was \n",
      "mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate \n",
      "for the task. He could make nothing of it. Bennigsen \n",

      "grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front of \n",

      "Here, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a \n",
      "great deal and with much heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, \n",
      "gave orders of great military importance. In front of \n",
      "Tuchkov’s troops was some high ground not occupied by \n",

      "white light without shadows, without perspective, without \n",
      "distinction of outline. All life appeared to him like magic-\n",
      "lantern pictures at which he had long been gazing by \n",
      "artificial light through a gl ass. Now he suddenly saw \n",
      "those badly daubed pictures in  clear daylight and without \n",
      "a glass. ‘Yes, yes! There they are, those false images that \n",
      "agitated, enraptured, and torm ented me,’ said he to \n",
      "himself, passing in review th e principal pictures of the \n",
      "magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold \n",
      "white daylight of his clear perception of death. ‘There \n",
      "they are, those rudely pain ted figures that once seemed \n",
      "splendid and mysterious. Glory, the good of society, love \n",
      "of a woman, the Fatherland itself- how important these \n",
      "pictures appeared to me, with what profound meaning \n",
      "they seemed to be filled! And it is all so simple, pale, and \n",
      "crude in the cold white light of this morning which I feel \n",
      "is dawning for me.’ The three great sorrows of his life \n",
      "held his attention in particul ar: his love for a woman, his \n",
      "father’s death, and the French invasion which had overrun \n",
      "half Russia. ‘Love... that lit tle girl who seemed to me \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1813 of 2882 \n",
      "brimming over with mystic fo rces! Yes, indeed, I loved \n",
      "her. I made romantic plans of love and happiness with \n",
      "her! Oh, what a boy I was!’ he said aloud bitterly. ‘Ah \n",
      "me! I believed in some ideal love which was to keep her \n",
      "faithful to me for the whole year of my absence! Like the \n",

      "and swept him aside, unconscious of his existence, as he \n",

      "his whole life fell to pieces. Princess Mary says it is a trial \n",
      "sent from above. What is the trial for, when he is not here \n",
      "and will never return? He is not here! For whom then is \n",

      "And the birches with their light and shade, the curly \n",
      "clouds, the smoke of the campfires, and all that was \n",
      "around him changed and seemed terrible and menacing. A \n",
      "cold shiver ran down his spine. He rose quickly, went out \n",
      "of the shed, and began to walk about. \n",
      "After he had returned, voices were heard outside the \n",

      "The red-nosed Captain Timokhin, formerly \n",
      "Dolokhov’s squadron commander, but now from lack of \n",
      "officers a battalion commander, shyly entered the shed \n",

      "Prince Andrew rose hastily, listened to the business \n",
      "they had come about, gave them some further \n",
      "instructions, and was about to dismiss them when he \n",
      "heard a familiar, lisping, voice behind the shed. \n",
      "‘Devil take it!’ said the voice of a man stumbling over \n",
      "something. \n",
      "Prince Andrew looked out of the shed and saw Pierre, \n",
      "who had tripped over a pole on the ground and had nearly \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1815 of 2882 \n",
      "fallen, coming his way. It was unpleasant to Prince \n",
      "Andrew to meet people of hi s own set in general, and \n",
      "Pierre especially, for he reminded him of all the painful \n",

      "‘You? What a surprise!’ sa id he. ‘What brings you \n",
      "here? This is unexpected!’ \n",
      "As he said this his eyes and face expressed more than \n",
      "coldness- they expressed hostility, which Pierre noticed at \n",
      "once. He had approached the shed full of animation, but \n",
      "on seeing Prince Andrew’s face he felt constrained and ill \n",

      "Have they reached Moscow at last?’ he asked seriously. \n",
      "‘Yes, they have. Julie Drubetskaya told me so. I went \n",

      "The officers were about to take leave, but Prince \n",
      "Andrew, apparently reluctant to be left alone with his \n",
      "friend, asked them to stay and have tea. Seats were \n",
      "brought in and so was the tea. The officers gazed with \n",
      "surprise at Pierre’s huge stout figure and listened to his \n",
      "talk of Moscow and the pos ition of our army, round \n",
      "which he had ridden. Prince Andrew remained silent, and \n",
      "his expression was so forbiddi ng that Pierre addressed his \n",
      "remarks chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander. \n",
      "‘So you understand the whole position of our troops?’ \n",
      "Prince Andrew interrupted him. \n",
      "‘Yes- that is, how do you mean?’ said Pierre. ‘Not \n",

      "perplexity at Prince Andrew. ‘Well, and what do think of \n",
      "Kutuzov’s appointment?’ he asked. \n",
      "‘I was very glad of his appointment, that’s all I know,’ \n",

      "What do you think of him?’ \n",
      "‘Ask them,’ replied Prince Andrew, indicating the \n",

      "‘We see light again, since his Serenity has been \n",

      "‘Why so?’ asked Pierre. \n",
      "‘Well, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me \n",
      "inform you. Why, when we  were retreating from \n",
      "Sventsyani we dare not touch a stick or a wisp of hay or \n",
      "anything. You see, we were going away, so he would get \n",
      "it all; wasn’t it so, your ex cellency?’ and again Timokhin \n",
      "turned to the prince. ‘But we daren’t. In our regiment two \n",

      "when his Serenity took command everything became \n",

      "1818 of 2882 \n",
      "Timokhin looked about in confusion, not knowing \n",
      "what or how to answer such  a question. Pierre put the \n",
      "same question to Prince Andrew. \n",
      "‘Why, so as not to lay waste the country we were \n",
      "abandoning to the enemy,’ said Prince Andrew with \n",
      "venomous irony. ‘It is very sound: one can’t permit the \n",
      "land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to marauding. \n",
      "At Smolensk too he judged correctly that the French \n",
      "might outflank us, as they had larger forces. But he could \n",
      "not understand this,’ cried Prince Andrew in a shrill voice \n",
      "that seemed to escape him involuntarily: ‘he could not \n",
      "understand that there, for the first time, we were fighting \n",
      "for Russian soil, and that there was a spirit in the men \n",
      "such as I had never seen be fore, that we had held the \n",
      "French for two days, and that that success had increased \n",
      "our strength tenfold. He ordered us to retreat, and all our \n",
      "efforts and losses went for nothing. He had no thought of \n",
      "betraying us, he tried to do the best he could, he thought \n",
      "out everything, and that is why he is unsuitable. He is \n",
      "unsuitable now, just because he plans out everything very \n",
      "thoroughly and accurately as every German has to. How \n",
      "can I explain?... Well, say your father has a German valet, \n",
      "and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your father’s \n",
      "requirements better than you could, then it’s all right to let \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1819 of 2882 \n",
      "him serve. But if your father is mortally si ck you’ll send \n",
      "the valet away and attend to your father with your own \n",
      "unpracticed, awkward hands, and will soothe him better \n",
      "than a skilled man who is a st ranger could. So it has been \n",
      "with Barclay. While Russia was well, a foreigner could \n",
      "serve her and be a splendid mini ster; but as soon as she is \n",
      "in danger she needs one of her own kin. But in your Club \n",
      "they have been making him out a traitor! They slander \n",
      "him as a traitor, and the only result will be that \n",
      "afterwards, ashamed of their false accusations, they will \n",
      "make him out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor, and \n",
      "that will be still more unjus t. He is an honest and very \n",
      "punctilious German.’ \n",
      "‘And they say he’s a skillful commander,’ rejoined \n",
      "Pierre. \n",
      "‘I don’t understand what is  meant by ‘a skillful \n",
      "commander,’’ replied Prince Andrew ironically. \n",
      "‘A skillful commander?’ re plied Pierre. ‘Why, one \n",
      "who foresees all contingenc ies... and foresees the \n",
      "adversary’s intentions.’ \n",
      "‘But that’s impossible,’ said Prince Andrew as if it \n",
      "were a matter settled long ago. \n",
      "Pierre looked at him in surprise. War and Peace  \n",
      "1820 of 2882 \n",
      "‘And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?’ he \n",
      "remarked. \n",
      "‘Yes,’ replied Prince Andrew , ‘but with this little \n",
      "difference, that in chess you may think over each move as \n",
      "long as you please and are not limited for time, and with \n",
      "this difference too, that a knight  is always stronger than a \n",
      "pawn, and two pawns are always stronger than one, while \n",
      "in war a battalion is sometime s stronger than a division \n",
      "and sometimes weaker than a company. The relative \n",
      "strength of bodies of tr oops can never be known to \n",
      "anyone. Believe me,’ he went  on, ‘if things depended on \n",
      "arrangements made by the staff, I should be there making \n",
      "arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve \n",
      "here in the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider \n",
      "that on us tomorrow’s battle will depend and not on those \n",
      "others.... Success never depends, and never will depend, \n",
      "on position, or equipment, or even on numbers, and least \n",
      "of all on position.’ \n",
      "‘But on what then?’ \n",
      "‘On the feeling that is in me and in him,’ he pointed to \n",
      "Timokhin, ‘and in each soldier.’ \n",
      "Prince Andrew glanced at Timokhin, who looked at his \n",
      "commander in alarm and bewilderment. In contrast to his \n",
      "former reticent taciturnity Prince Andrew now seemed \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1821 of 2882 \n",
      "excited. He could apparently not refrain from expressing \n",
      "the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him. \n",
      "‘A battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! \n",
      "Why did we lose the battle at Austerlitz? The French \n",
      "losses were almost equal to ours, but very early we said to \n",
      "ourselves that we were losing the battle, and we did lose \n",
      "it. And we said so because we had nothing to fight for \n",
      "there, we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon \n",
      "as we could. ‘We’ve lost, so let us run,’ and we ran. If we \n",
      "had not said that till the evening, heaven knows what \n",
      "might not have happened. But tomorrow we shan’t say it! \n",
      "You talk about our position, the left flank weak and the \n",
      "right flank too extended,’  he went on. ‘That’s all \n",
      "nonsense, there’s nothing of the kind. But what awaits us \n",
      "tomorrow? A hundred million most diverse chances \n",
      "which will be decided on the instant by the fact that our \n",
      "men or theirs run or do not r un, and that this man or that \n",
      "man is killed, but all that is being done at present is only \n",
      "play. The fact is that those men with whom you have \n",
      "ridden round the position not only do not help matters, but \n",
      "hinder. They are only concer ned with their own petty \n",
      "interests.’ \n",
      "‘At such a moment?’ said Pierre reproachfully. War and Peace  \n",
      "1822 of 2882 \n",
      "‘At such a moment!’ Prin ce Andrew repeated. ‘To \n",
      "them it is only a moment affording opportunities to \n",
      "undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross or ribbon. For \n",
      "me tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a hundred \n",
      "thousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have \n",
      "met to fight, and the thing is that these two hundred \n",
      "thousand men will fight and the side that fights more \n",
      "fiercely and spares itself least will win. And if you like I \n",
      "will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles \n",
      "those at the top may make, we shall win tomorrow’s \n",
      "battle. Tomorrow, happen what may, we shall win!’ \n",
      "‘There now, your excellency! That’s the truth, the real \n",
      "truth,’ said Timokhin. ‘Who would spare himself now? \n",
      "The soldiers in my battalion, believe me, wouldn’t drink \n",
      "their vodka! ‘It’s not the day for that!’ they say.’ \n",
      "All were silent. The officers rose. Prince Andrew went \n",
      "out of the shed with them, giving final orders to the \n",
      "adjutant. After they had gone Pierre approached Prince \n",
      "Andrew and was about to start a conversation when they \n",
      "heard the clatter of three horse s’ hoofs on the road not far \n",
      "from the shed, and looking in that direction Prince \n",
      "Andrew recognized Wolz ogen and Clausewitz \n",
      "accompanied by a Cossack. They rode close by \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1823 of 2882 \n",
      "continuing to converse, and Prince Andrew involuntarily \n",
      "heard these words: \n",
      "‘Der Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden. Der Ansicht \n",
      "kann ich nicht genug Preis geben,’* said one of them. \n",
      "*\"The war must be extended widely. I cannot \n",
      "sufficiently commend that view.’ \n",
      "‘Oh, ja,’ said the other, ‘der Zweck ist nur den Feind \n",
      "zu schwachen, so kann man gewiss nicht den Verlust der \n",
      "Privat-Personen in Achtung nehmen.’* \n",
      "*\"Oh, yes, the only aim is to weaken the enemy, so of \n",
      "course one cannot take into account the loss of private \n",
      "individuals.’ \n",
      "‘Oh, no,’ agreed the other. \n",
      "‘Extend widely!’ said Prin ce Andrew with an angry \n",
      "snort, when they had ridden pa st. ‘In that ‘extend’ were \n",
      "my father, son, and sister, at Bald Hills. That’s all the \n",
      "same to him! That’s what I was saying to you- those \n",
      "German gentlemen won’t win the battle tomorrow but \n",
      "will only make all the mess th ey can, because they have \n",
      "nothing in their German heads but theories not worth an \n",
      "empty eggshell and haven’t in their hearts the one thing \n",
      "needed tomorrow- that which Timokhin has. They have \n",
      "yielded up all Europe to him, and have now come to teach \n",
      "us. Fine teachers!’ and again his voice grew shrill. War and Peace  \n",
      "1824 of 2882 \n",
      "‘So you think we shall win tomorrow’s battle?’ asked \n",
      "Pierre. \n",
      "‘Yes, yes,’ answered Prince Andrew absently. ‘One \n",
      "thing I would do if I had the power,’ he began again, ‘I \n",
      "would not take prisoners. Why take prisoners? It’s \n",
      "chivalry! The French have destroyed my home and are on \n",
      "their way to destroy Moscow, they have outraged and are \n",
      "outraging me every moment. They are my enemies. In my \n",
      "opinion they are all criminal s. And so thinks Timokhin \n",
      "and the whole army. They should be executed! Since they \n",
      "are my foes they cannot be my friends, whatever may \n",
      "have been said at Tilsit.’ \n",
      "‘Yes, yes,’ muttered Pierre, looking with shining eyes \n",
      "at Prince Andrew. ‘I quite agree with you!’ \n",
      "The question that had perturbed Pierre on the \n",
      "Mozhaysk hill and all that day now seemed to him quite \n",
      "clear and completely solv ed. He now understood the \n",
      "whole meaning and importance of this war and of the \n",
      "impending battle. All he had seen that day, all the \n",
      "significant and stern expression s on the faces he had seen \n",
      "in passing, were lit up fo r him by a new light. He \n",
      "understood that latent heat (a s they say in physics) of \n",
      "patriotism which was present in all these men he had \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1825 of 2882 \n",
      "seen, and this explained to him why they all prepared for \n",
      "death calmly, and as it were lightheartedly. \n",
      "‘Not take prisoners,’ Prince Andrew continued: ‘That \n",
      "by itself would quite change the whole war and make it \n",
      "less cruel. As it is we have pl ayed at war- that’s what’s \n",
      "vile! We play at magnanimity  and all that stuff. Such \n",
      "magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and \n",
      "sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being \n",
      "killed: she is so kind-hearted that she can’t look at blood, \n",
      "but enjoys eating the calf served  up with sauce. They talk \n",
      "to us of the rules of war, of chivalry, of flags of truce, of \n",
      "mercy to the unfortunate and so on. It’s all rubbish! I saw \n",
      "chivalry and flags of truce in 1805; they humbugged us \n",
      "and we humbugged them. They plunder other people’s \n",
      "houses, issue false paper money, and worst of all they kill \n",
      "my children and my father, and then talk of rules of war \n",
      "and magnanimity to foes! Take no prisoners, but kill and \n",
      "be killed! He who has come to this as I have through the \n",
      "same sufferings..’ \n",
      "Prince Andrew, who had thought it was all the same to \n",
      "him whether or not Moscow was taken as Smolensk had \n",
      "been, was suddenly checked in his speech by an \n",
      "unexpected cramp in his throat. He paced up and down a War and Peace  \n",
      "1826 of 2882 \n",
      "few times in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and \n",
      "his lips quivered as he began speaking. \n",
      "‘If there was none of this magnanimity in war, we \n",
      "should go to war only when it was worth while going to \n",
      "certain death, as now. Then there would not be war \n",
      "because Paul Ivanovich had offended Michael Ivanovich. \n",
      "And when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! \n",
      "And then the determination of  the troops would be quite \n",
      "different. Then all these Westphalians and Hessians \n",
      "whom Napoleon is leading w ould not follow him into \n",
      "Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and \n",
      "Prussia without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the \n",
      "most horrible thing in life;  and we ought to understand \n",
      "that and not play at war. We  ought to accept this terrible \n",
      "necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in that: get rid of \n",
      "falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is \n",
      "now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. \n",

      "If it had depended on Napoleon’s will to fight or not to \n",
      "fight the battle of Borodino, and if this or that other \n",

      "would have been the savior of  Russia. Along that line of \n",

      "what he was jesting at) when he saw that the Massacre of \n",

      "formed by the will of one man, Peter I, or that the French \n",
      "Empire was formed and the war with Russia begun by the \n",
      "will of one man, Napoleon, that argument seems not \n",
      "merely untrue and irrational, but contrary to all human \n",
      "reality. To the question of wh at causes historic events \n",
      "another answer presents itself,  namely, that the course of \n",

      "the coincidence of the wills of  all who take part in the \n",
      "events, and that a Napoleon’s influence on the course of \n",

      "Strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that \n",
      "the Massacre of St. Bartholomew was not due to Charles \n",

      "abundantly confirms it. \n",
      "At the battle of Borodino Napoleon shot at no one and \n",

      "The French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the \n",

      "by their own volition. The whol e army- French, Italian, \n",
      "German, Polish, and Dutch- hungry, ragged, and weary of \n",

      "road to Moscow that the wi ne was drawn and must be \n",

      "as conquerors in Moscow. So it was not because of \n",
      "Napoleon’s commands that they killed their fellow men. \n",
      "And it was not Napoleon who directed the course of \n",
      "the battle, for none of his orders were executed and during \n",
      "the battle he did not know wh at was going on before him. \n",

      "least of the transport soldiers. \n",
      "Moreover, the assertion made by various writers that \n",
      "his cold was the cause of his dispositions not being as \n",
      "well planned as on former occasions, and of his orders \n",
      "during the battle not being as  good as previously, is quite \n",
      "baseless, which again shows that Napoleon’s cold on the \n",

      "The dispositions cited above are not at all worse, but \n",
      "are even better, than previous dispositions by which he \n",

      "were also no worse than formerly, but much the same as \n",
      "usual. These dispositions and orders only seem worse \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",

      "battlefield itself, of Bor odino and the hollows on both \n",
      "sides of the Kolocha. \n",
      "Above the Kolocha, in Borodino and on both sides of \n",
      "it, especially to the left where the Voyna flowing between \n",
      "its marshy banks falls into the Kolocha, a mist had spread \n",
      "which seemed to melt, to dissolve, and to become \n",
      "translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically \n",
      "colored and outlined everything. The smoke of the guns \n",
      "mingled with this mist, and over the whole expanse and \n",
      "through that mist the rays of the morning sun were \n",
      "reflected, flashing back like lightning from the water, \n",
      "from the dew, and from the bayonets of the troops \n",
      "crowded together by the rive rbanks and in Borodino. A \n",
      "white church could be seen through the mist, and here and \n",
      "there the roofs of huts in Borodino as well as dense \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1859 of 2882 \n",
      "masses of soldiers, or gr een ammunition chests and \n",
      "ordnance. And all this moved, or seemed to move, as the \n",
      "smoke and mist spread out over the whole space. Just as \n",
      "in the mist-enveloped hollow near Borodino, so along the \n",
      "entire line outside and above  it and especially in the \n",
      "woods and fields to the left , in the valleys and on the \n",
      "summits of the high ground, clouds of powder smoke \n",
      "seemed continually to sp ring up out of nothing, now \n",
      "singly, now several at a time, some translucent, others \n",
      "dense, which, swelling, gr owing, rolling, and blending, \n",
      "extended over the whole expanse. \n",
      "These puffs of smoke and (strange to say) the sound of \n",
      "sound of the firing produced the chief beauty of the \n",
      "spectacle. \n",
      "‘Puff!’- suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was \n",
      "seen merging from violet into gray and milky white, and \n",
      "‘boom!’ came the report a second later. \n",
      "‘Puff! puff!’- and two clouds arose pushing one \n",
      "another and blending togeth er; and ‘boom, boom!’ came \n",
      "the sounds confirming what the eye had seen. \n",
      "Pierre glanced round at th e first cloud, which he had \n",
      "seen as a round compact ball, and in its place already \n",
      "were balloons of smoke floati ng to one side, and- ‘puff’ \n",
      "(with a pause)- ‘puff, puff!’ three and then four more War and Peace  \n",
      "1860 of 2882 \n",
      "appeared and then from each, with the same interval- \n",
      "‘boom- boom, boom!’ came the fine, firm, precise sounds \n",
      "in reply. It seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes \n",
      "ran and sometimes stood still while woods, fields, and \n",
      "glittering bayonets ran past them. From the left, over \n",
      "fields and bushes, those large balls of smoke were \n",
      "continually appearing followed by their solemn reports, \n",
      "while nearer still, in the hollows and woods, there burst \n",
      "from the muskets small cloudlets that had no time to \n",
      "become balls, but had their lit tle echoes in just the same \n",
      "way. ‘Trakh-ta-ta-takh!’ came the frequent crackle of \n",
      "musketry, but it was irregular  and feeble in comparison \n",
      "with the reports of the cannon. \n",
      "Pierre wished to be there with that smoke, those \n",
      "shining bayonets, that move ment, and those sounds. He \n",
      "turned to look at Kutuzov and his suite, to compare his \n",
      "impressions with those of others. They were all looking at \n",
      "the field of battle as he was, and, as it seemed to him, with \n",
      "the same feelings. All their faces were now shining with \n",
      "that latent warmth of feeling Pierre had noticed the day \n",
      "before and had fully understood after his talk with Prince \n",
      "Andrew. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1861 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Go, my dear fellow, go... and Christ be with you!’ \n",
      "Kutuzov was saying to a general who stood beside him, \n",
      "not taking his eye from the battlefield. \n",
      "Having received this order the general passed by Pierre \n",
      "on his way down the knoll. \n",
      "‘To the crossing!’ said the general coldly and sternly in \n",
      "reply to one of the staff who asked where he was going. \n",
      "‘I’ll go there too, I too!’ thought Pierre, and followed \n",
      "the general. \n",
      "The general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought \n",
      "him. Pierre went to his groom who was holding his horses \n",
      "and, asking which was the quietest, clambered onto it, \n",
      "seized it by the mane, and turning out his toes pressed his \n",
      "heels against its sides and, feeling that his spectacles were \n",
      "slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins, he \n",
      "galloped after the general, cau sing the staff officers to \n",

      "Having descended the hill the general after whom \n",
      "Pierre was galloping turned sharply to the left, and Pierre, \n",
      "losing sight of him, galloped in among some ranks of \n",
      "infantry marching ahead of him. He tried to pass either in \n",
      "front of them or to the right or left, but there were soldiers \n",
      "everywhere, all with expression and busy with some \n",
      "unseen but evidently important task. They all gazed with \n",
      "the same dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout \n",
      "man in a white hat, who for some unknown reason \n",
      "threatened to trample them under his horse’s hoofs. \n",
      "‘Why ride into the middle of the battalion?’ one of \n",
      "them shouted at him. \n",
      "Another prodded his horse with the butt end of a \n",
      "musket, and Pierre, bending over his saddlebow and \n",
      "hardly able to control his shying horse, galloped ahead of \n",
      "the soldiers where there was a free space. \n",
      "There was a bridge ahead of him, where other soldiers \n",
      "stood firing. Pierre rode up to  them. Without being aware \n",
      "of it he had come to the bridge across the Kolocha \n",
      "between Gorki and Borodino, which the French (having \n",
      "occupied Borodino) were att acking in the first phase of \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1863 of 2882 \n",
      "the battle. Pierre saw that th ere was a bridge in front of \n",
      "him and that soldiers were doing something on both sides \n",
      "of it and in the meadow, among the rows of new-mown \n",
      "hay which he had taken no notice of amid the smoke of \n",
      "the campfires the day before; but despite the incessant \n",
      "firing going on there he had no id ea that this was the field \n",
      "of battle. He did not noti ce the sound of the bullets \n",
      "whistling from every side, or the projectiles that flew over \n",
      "him, did not see the enemy on the other side of the river, \n",
      "and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded, \n",
      "though many fell near him. He  looked about him with a \n",
      "smile which did not leave his face. \n",
      "‘Why’s that fellow in front  of the line?’ shouted \n",
      "somebody at him again. \n",
      "‘To the left!... Keep to the right!’ the men shouted to \n",
      "him. \n",
      "Pierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered \n",
      "one of Raevski’s adjutants wh om he knew. The adjutant \n",
      "looked angrily at him, evidentl y also intending to shout at \n",
      "him, but on recognizing him he nodded. \n",
      "‘How have you got here?’ he said, and galloped on. \n",
      "Pierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, \n",
      "and afraid of getting in so meone’s way again, galloped \n",
      "after the adjutant. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1864 of 2882 \n",
      "‘What’s happening here? Ma y I come with you?’ he \n",
      "asked. \n",
      "‘One moment, one moment!’ replied the adjutant, and \n",
      "riding up to a stout colonel who was standing in the \n",
      "meadow, he gave him some message and then addressed \n",
      "Pierre. \n",
      "‘Why have you come here, Count?’ he asked with a \n",
      "smile. ‘Still inquisitive?’ \n",
      "‘Yes, yes,’ assented Pierre. \n",
      "But the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on. \n",
      "‘Here it’s tolerable,’ said he , ‘but with Bagration on \n",
      "the left flank they’re getting it frightfully hot.’ \n",
      "‘Really?’ said Pierre. ‘Where is that?’ \n",
      "‘Come along with me to our  knoll. We can get a view \n",
      "from there and in our battery it is still bearable,’ said the \n",
      "adjutant. ‘Will you come?’ \n",
      "‘Yes, I’ll come with you,’ replied Pierre, looking round \n",
      "for his groom. \n",
      "It was only now that he noticed wounded men \n",
      "staggering along or being carri ed on stretchers. On that \n",
      "very meadow he had ridden over the day before, a soldier \n",
      "was lying athwart the rows of  scented hay, with his head \n",
      "thrown awkwardly back and his shako off. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1865 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Why haven’t they carried him away?’ Pierre was \n",
      "about to ask, but seeing the stern expression of the \n",
      "adjutant who was also l ooking that way, he checked \n",
      "himself. \n",
      "Pierre did not find his gr oom and rode along the \n",
      "hollow with the adjutant to  Raevski’s Redoubt. His horse \n",
      "lagged behind the adjutant’s and jolted him at every step. \n",
      "‘You don’t seem to be used to riding, Count?’ \n",
      "remarked the adjutant. \n",
      "‘No it’s not that, but her action seems so jerky,’ said \n",
      "Pierre in a puzzled tone. \n",
      "‘Why... she’s wounded!’ said the adjutant. ‘In the off \n",
      "foreleg above the knee. A bu llet, no doubt. I congratulate \n",
      "you, Count, on your baptism of fire!’ \n",
      "Having ridden in the smoke  past the Sixth Corps, \n",
      "behind the artillery which ha d been moved forward and \n",
      "was in action, deafening them with the noise of firing, \n",
      "they came to a small wood. There it was cool and quiet, \n",
      "with a scent of autumn. Pierre and the adjutant \n",
      "dismounted and walked up the hill on foot. \n",
      "‘Is the general here?’ aske d the adjutant on reaching \n",
      "the knoll. \n",
      "‘He was here a minute ago but has just gone that way,’ \n",
      "someone told him, pointing to the right. War and Peace  \n",
      "1866 of 2882 \n",
      "The adjutant looked at Pierre as if puzzled what to do \n",
      "with him now. \n",
      "‘Don’t trouble about me,’ said Pierre. ‘I’ll go up onto \n",
      "the knoll if I may?’ \n",
      "‘Yes, do. You’ll see everything from there and it’s less \n",
      "dangerous, and I’ll come for you.’ \n",
      "Pierre went to the battery  and the adjutant rode on. \n",
      "They did not meet again, a nd only much later did Pierre \n",
      "learn that he lost an arm that day. \n",
      "The knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous \n",
      "one afterwards known to the Russians as the Knoll \n",
      "Battery or Raevski’s Redoubt, and to the French as la \n",
      "grande redoute, la fatale re doute, la redoute du centre, \n",
      "around which tens of thousands fell, and which the French \n",
      "regarded as the key to the whole position. \n",
      "This redoubt consisted of a knoll, on three sides of \n",
      "which trenches had been dug. Within the entrenchment \n",
      "stood ten guns that were being fired through openings in \n",
      "the earthwork. \n",
      "In line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns \n",
      "which also fired incessantly. A little behind the guns \n",
      "stood infantry. When ascending that knoll Pierre had no \n",
      "notion that this spot, on which small trenches had been \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1867 of 2882 \n",
      "dug and from which a few guns were firing, was the most \n",
      "important point of the battle. \n",
      "On the contrary, just because he happened to be there \n",
      "he thought it one of the least significant parts of the field. \n",
      "Having reached the knoll, Pierre sat down at one end \n",
      "of a trench surrounding the batt ery and gazed at what was \n",
      "going on around him with an unconsciously happy smile. \n",
      "Occasionally he rose and walk ed about the battery still \n",
      "with that same smile, trying not to obstruct the soldiers \n",
      "who were loading, hauling the guns, and continually \n",
      "running past him with bags and charges. The guns of that \n",
      "battery were being fired continually one after another with \n",
      "a deafening roar, enveloping the whole neighborhood in \n",
      "powder smoke. \n",
      "In contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen \n",
      "placed in support, here in the battery where a small \n",
      "number of men busy at their work were separated from \n",
      "the rest by a trench, everyone experienced a common and \n",
      "as it were family feeling of animation. \n",
      "The intrusion of Pierre’s nonmilitary figure in a white \n",
      "hat made an unpleasant impressi on at first. The soldiers \n",
      "looked askance at him with su rprise and even alarm as \n",
      "they went past him. The senior artillery officer, a tall, \n",
      "long-legged, pockmarked man, moved over to Pierre as if War and Peace  \n",
      "1868 of 2882 \n",
      "to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him \n",
      "with curiosity. \n",
      "A young round-faced officer, quite a boy still and \n",
      "evidently only just out of the Cadet College, who was \n",
      "zealously commanding the two guns entrusted to him, \n",
      "addressed Pierre sternly. \n",
      "‘Sir,’ he said, ‘permit me to ask you to stand aside. \n",
      "You must not be here.’ \n",
      "The soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they \n",
      "looked at Pierre. But when they had convinced \n",
      "themselves that this man in the white hat was doing no \n",
      "harm, but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench with \n",
      "a shy smile or, politely making way for the soldiers, paced \n",
      "up and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were \n",
      "on a boulevard, their feeling of  hostile distrust gradually \n",
      "began to change into a kindly and bantering sympathy, \n",
      "such as soldiers feel for their dogs, cocks, goats, and in \n",
      "general for the animals that live with the regiment. The \n",
      "men soon accepted Pierre into their family, adopted him, \n",
      "gave him a nickname (\"our ge ntleman’), and made kindly \n",
      "fun of him among themselves. \n",
      "A shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he \n",
      "looked around with a smile as he brushed from his clothes \n",
      "some earth it had thrown up. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1869 of 2882 \n",
      "‘And how’s it you’re not afraid, sir, really now?’ a red-\n",
      "faced, broad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre, with a grin \n",
      "that disclosed a set of sound, white teeth. \n",
      "‘Are you afraid, then?’ said Pierre. \n",
      "‘What else do you expect?’ answered the soldier. ‘She \n",
      "has no mercy, you know! When she comes spluttering \n",
      "down, out go your innards. One can’t help being afraid,’ \n",
      "he said laughing. \n",
      "Several of the men, with bright kindly faces, stopped \n",
      "beside Pierre. They seemed not to have expected him to \n",
      "talk like anybody else, and the discovery that he did so \n",
      "delighted them. \n",
      "‘It’s the business of us soldiers. But in a gentleman it’s \n",
      "wonderful! There’s a gentleman for you!’ \n",
      "‘To your places!’ cried the young officer to the men \n",
      "gathered round Pierre. \n",
      "The young officer was eviden tly exercising his duties \n",
      "for the first or second time and therefore treated both his \n",
      "superiors and the men with great precision and formality. \n",
      "The booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry \n",
      "were growing more intens e over the whole field, \n",
      "especially to the left where Bagration’s fleches were, but \n",
      "where Pierre was the smoke of the firing made it almost \n",
      "impossible to distinguish a nything. Moreover, his whole War and Peace  \n",
      "1870 of 2882 \n",
      "attention was engrossed by watching the family circle- \n",
      "separated from all else- formed  by the men in the battery. \n",
      "His first unconscious feeli ng of joyful animation \n",
      "produced by the sights and s ounds of the battlefield was \n",
      "now replaced by another, especially since he had seen that \n",
      "soldier lying alone in the hayfield. Now, seated on the \n",
      "slope of the trench, he observ ed the faces of those around \n",
      "him. \n",
      "By ten o’clock some twen ty men had already been \n",
      "carried away from the batte ry; two guns were smashed \n",
      "and cannon balls fell more and more frequently on the \n",
      "battery and spent bullets bu zzed and whistled around. But \n",
      "the men in the battery seemed not to notice this, and \n",
      "merry voices and jokes were heard on all sides. \n",
      "‘A live one!’ shouted a man as a whistling shell \n",
      "approached. \n",
      "‘Not this way! To the infa ntry!’ added another with \n",
      "loud laughter, seeing the shell fly past and fall into the \n",
      "ranks of the supports. \n",
      "‘Are you bowing to a friend, eh?’ remarked another, \n",
      "chaffing a peasant who ducked low as a cannon ball flew \n",
      "over. \n",
      "Several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench, \n",
      "looking out to see what was happening in front. \n",

      "1871 of 2882 \n",
      "‘They’ve withdrawn the front line, it has retired,’ said \n",
      "they, pointing over the earthwork. \n",
      "‘Mind your own business,’ an old sergeant shouted at \n",
      "them. ‘If they’ve retired it’ s because there’s work for \n",
      "them to do farther back.’ \n",
      "And the sergeant, taking one of the men by the \n",
      "shoulders, gave him a shove with his knee. This was \n",
      "followed by a burst of laughter. \n",
      "‘To the fifth gun, wheel it up!’ came shouts from one \n",
      "side. \n",
      "‘Now then, all together, lik e bargees!’ rose the merry \n",
      "voices of those who were moving the gun. \n",
      "‘Oh, she nearly knocked our gentleman’s hat off!’ \n",
      "cried the red-faced humorist, showing his teeth chaffing \n",
      "Pierre. ‘Awkward baggage!’ he added reproachfully to a \n",
      "cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a man’s leg. \n",
      "‘Now then, you foxes!’ said another, laughing at some \n",
      "militiamen who, stooping low, entered the battery to carry \n",
      "away the wounded man. \n",
      "‘So this gruel isn’t to your taste? Oh, you crows! \n",

      "‘they don’t like it at all!’ War and Peace  \n",
      "1872 of 2882 \n",
      "Pierre noticed that after ev ery ball that hit the redoubt, \n",
      "and after every loss, the liveliness increased more and \n",
      "more. \n",
      "As the flames of the fire hidden within come more and \n",
      "more vividly and rapidl y from an approaching \n",
      "thundercloud, so, as if in oppos ition to what was taking \n",
      "place, the lightning of hidden fire growing more and more \n",
      "intense glowed in the faces of these men. \n",
      "Pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not \n",
      "concerned to know what was happening there; he was \n",
      "entirely absorbed in watching this fire which burned ever \n",
      "more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the \n",

      "At ten o’clock the infantry that had been among the \n",
      "bushes in front of the battery and along the Kamenka \n",

      "running back past it carrying their wounded on their \n",
      "muskets. A general with his suite came to the battery, and \n",
      "after speaking to the colonel gave Pierre an angry look \n",
      "and went away again having ordered the infantry supports \n",
      "behind the battery to lie down, so as to be less exposed to \n",
      "fire. After this from amid the ranks of infantry to the right \n",
      "of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts of \n",

      "of infantry moved forward. \n",
      "Pierre looked over the wall of the trench and was \n",
      "particularly struck by a pale young officer who, letting his \n",

      "been removed. Around the cannon the men moved still \n",
      "more briskly and busily. No one any longer took notice of \n",
      "Pierre. Once or twice he was shouted at for being in the \n",
      "way. The senior officer move d with big, rapid strides \n",
      "from one gun to another with  a frowning face. The young \n",
      "officer, with his face still mo re flushed, commanded the \n",
      "men more scrupulously than ever. The soldiers handed up \n",
      "the charges, turned, loaded, and did their business with \n",

      "confused, and misty in Pierre’s eyes. \n",
      "One cannon ball after another whistled by and struck \n",

      "they had been running together at full speed before they War and Peace  \n",
      "1878 of 2882 \n",
      "saw one another- Pierre put out his hands and seized the \n",
      "man (a French officer) by the shoulder with one hand and \n",
      "by the throat with the other. The officer, dropping his \n",

      "1884 of 2882 \n",
      "at any given moment and because many of the adjutants \n",

      "and the bridge over the Kolocha was in the hands of the \n",

      "the French had been repulsed, the fleches had in fact been \n",
      "recaptured by other French troops, and Davout was alive \n",
      "and only slightly bruised. On the basis of these \n",
      "necessarily untrustworthy reports Napoleon gave his \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1885 of 2882 \n",
      "orders, which had either been  executed before he gave \n",

      "former battles he had only c onsidered the possibilities of \n",

      "The Russians stood in serried ranks behind Semenovsk \n",
      "village and its knoll, and th eir guns boomed incessantly \n",
      "along their line and sent forth clouds of smoke. It was no \n",

      "be of no avail either to the French or the Russians. \n",
      "Napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie \n",

      "supposed to be directed by him and to depend on him, and \n",
      "from its lack of success this  affair, for the first time, \n",
      "seemed to him unnecessary and horrible. \n",
      "One of the generals rode up to Napoleon and ventured \n",

      "On the rug-covered bench where Pierre had seen him \n",

      "that of him; but when listeni ng to the reports it seemed as \n",
      "if he were not interested in the import of the words \n",
      "spoken, but rather in something else- in the expression of \n",
      "face and tone of voi ce of those who we re reporting. By \n",
      "long years of military experi ence he knew, and with the \n",
      "wisdom of age understood, that  it is impossible for one \n",

      "1897 of 2882 \n",
      "watched this force and guided it in as far as that was in his \n",
      "power. \n",
      "Kutuzov’s general expression was one of concentrated \n",
      "quiet attention, and his face wore  a strained look as if he \n",
      "found it difficult to master th e fatigue of his old and \n",
      "feeble body. \n",
      "At eleven o’clock they brought him news that the \n",

      "swayed his head. \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1899 of 2882 \n",
      "expression of extreme tension. He was satisfied with the \n",
      "day’s success- a success exce eding his expectations, but \n",

      "the guns boomed, and out of the mysterious domain of \n",
      "smoke that overlay the whole space in front, quick hissing \n",
      "cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly. \n",
      "At times, as if to allow them a respite, a quarter of an hour \n",
      "passed during which the cannon ba lls and shells all flew \n",
      "overhead, but sometimes several men were torn from the \n",
      "regiment in a minute and the slain were continually being \n",
      "dragged away and the wounded carried off. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1905 of 2882 \n",
      "With each fresh blow less and less chance of life \n",
      "remained for those not yet ki lled. The regiment stood in \n",
      "columns of battalion, three hundred paces apart, but \n",
      "nevertheless the men were al ways in one and the same \n",
      "mood. All alike were taciturn and morose. Talk was rarely \n",
      "heard in the ranks, and it ceased altogether every time the \n",
      "thud of a successful shot and the cry of ‘stretchers!’ was \n",
      "heard. Most of the time, by th eir officers’ order, the men \n",
      "sat on the ground. One, having taken off his shako, \n",
      "carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them \n",
      "tight again; another, rubbi ng some dry clay between his \n",
      "palms, polished his bayonet; another fingered the strap \n",
      "and pulled the buckle of hi s bandolier, while another \n",
      "smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put his boots on \n",
      "again. Some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed \n",
      "ground, or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield. \n",
      "All seemed fully absorbed in these pursuits. When men \n",
      "were killed or wounded, when rows of stretchers went \n",
      "past, when some troops retreated, and when great masses \n",
      "of the enemy came into view  through the smoke, no one \n",
      "paid any attention to these things. But when our artillery \n",
      "or cavalry advanced or some of  our infantry were seen to \n",
      "move forward, words of approval were heard on all sides. \n",
      "But the liveliest attention was attracted by occurrences War and Peace  \n",
      "1906 of 2882 \n",
      "quite apart from, and unconnected  with, the battle. It was \n",
      "as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found \n",
      "relief in everyday, commonplace occurrences. A battery \n",
      "of artillery was passing in front of the regiment. The horse \n",
      "of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace. ‘Hey, look \n",
      "at the trace horse!... Get her leg out! She’ll fall.... Ah, they \n",
      "don’t see it!’ came identical shouts from the ranks all \n",
      "along the regiment. Another time, general attention was \n",
      "attracted by a small brown dog, coming heaven knows \n",
      "whence, which trotted in a preoccupied manner in front of \n",
      "the ranks with tail stiffly er ect till suddenly a shell fell \n",
      "close by, when it yelped, tucked its tail between its legs, \n",
      "and darted aside. Yells and sh rieks of laughter rose from \n",
      "the whole regiment. But such distractions lasted only a \n",
      "moment, and for eight hours the men had been inactive, \n",
      "without food, in constant fear of death, and their pale and \n",
      "gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier. \n",
      "Prince Andrew, pale and gloomy like everyone in the \n",
      "regiment, paced up and down from the border of one \n",
      "patch to another, at the edge  of the meadow beside an \n",
      "oatfield, with head bowed and arms behind his back. \n",
      "There was nothing for him to do and no orders to be \n",
      "given. Everything went on of itself. The killed were \n",
      "dragged from the front, the wounded carried away, and \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1907 of 2882 \n",
      "the ranks closed up. If any sold iers ran to the rear they \n",
      "returned immediately and hastily. At first Prince Andrew, \n",
      "considering it his duty to r ouse the courage of the men \n",
      "and to set them an example, walked about among the \n",
      "ranks, but he soon became convinced that this was \n",
      "unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teach \n",
      "them. All the powers of his soul , as of every soldier there, \n",
      "were unconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation \n",
      "of the horrors of their situation. He walked along the \n",
      "meadow, dragging his feet, rustling the grass, and gazing \n",
      "at the dust that covered his boots; now he took big strides \n",
      "trying to keep to the footprin ts left on the meadow by the \n",
      "mowers, then he counted his steps, calculating how often \n",
      "he must walk from one strip to another to walk a mile, \n",
      "then he stripped the flowers from the wormwood that \n",
      "grew along a boundary rut, rubbed them in his palms, and \n",
      "smelled their pungent, sweetly  bitter scent. Nothing \n",
      "remained of the previous day’s thoughts. He thought of \n",
      "nothing. He listened with weary ears to the ever-recurring \n",
      "sounds, distinguishing the whis tle of flying projectiles \n",
      "from the booming of the reports, glanced at the tiresomely \n",
      "familiar faces of the men of the first battalion, and waited. \n",
      "‘Here it comes... this one is  coming our way again!’ he \n",
      "thought, listening to an approaching whistle in the hidden War and Peace  \n",
      "1908 of 2882 \n",
      "region of smoke. ‘One, another! Again! It has hit....’ He \n",
      "stopped and looked at the ranks. ‘No, it has gone over. \n",
      "But this one has hit!’ And again he started trying to reach \n",
      "the boundary strip in sixteen paces. A whizz and a thud! \n",
      "Five paces from him, a cannon ball tore up the dry earth \n",
      "and disappeared. A chill ran down his back. Again he \n",
      "glanced at the ranks. Probably many had been hit- a large \n",
      "crowd had gathered near the second battalion. \n",
      "‘Adjutant!’ he shouted. ‘O rder them not to crowd \n",
      "together.’ \n",
      "The adjutant, having obe yed this instruction, \n",
      "approached Prince Andrew. From the other side a \n",
      "battalion commander rode up. \n",
      "‘Look out!’ came a frightened cry from a soldier and, \n",
      "like a bird whirring in rapi d flight and alighting on the \n",
      "ground, a shell dropped with little noise within two steps \n",
      "of Prince Andrew and close to the battalion commander’s \n",
      "horse. The horse first, regard less of whether it was right \n",
      "or wrong to show fear, snorte d, reared almost throwing \n",
      "the major, and galloped aside. The horse’s terror infected \n",
      "the men. \n",
      "‘Lie down!’ cried the adjutant, throwing himself flat on \n",
      "the ground. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1909 of 2882 \n",
      "Prince Andrew hesitated. The smoking shell spun like \n",
      "a top between him and the prostrate adjutant, near a \n",
      "wormwood plant between the field and the meadow. \n",
      "‘Can this be death?’ th ought Prince Andrew, looking \n",
      "with a quite new, envious glance at the grass, the \n",
      "wormwood, and the streamlet of smoke that  curled up \n",
      "from the rotating black ball. ‘I cannot, I do not wish to \n",
      "die. I love life- I l ove this grass, this earth, this air....’ He \n",
      "thought this, and at the same time remembered that people \n",
      "were looking at him. \n",
      "‘It’s shameful, sir!’ he said to the adjutant. ‘What..’ \n",
      "He did not finish speaking. At one and the same \n",
      "moment came the sound of an explosion, a whistle of \n",
      "splinters as from a breaking window frame, a suffocating \n",
      "smell of powder, and Prince Andrew started to one side, \n",
      "raising his arm, and fell on hi s chest. Several officers ran \n",
      "up to him. From the right side of his abdomen, blood was \n",
      "welling out making a large stain on the grass. \n",
      "The militiamen with stretchers who were called up \n",
      "stood behind the officers. Prince Andrew lay on his chest \n",
      "with his face in the grass, breathing heavily and noisily. \n",
      "‘What are you waiting for? Come along!’ War and Peace  \n",
      "1910 of 2882 \n",
      "The peasants went up and took him by his shoulders \n",
      "and legs, but he moaned piteously and, exchanging looks, \n",
      "they set him down again. \n",
      "‘Pick him up, lift him, it’s all the same!’ cried \n",
      "someone. \n",
      "They again took him by the shoulders and laid him on \n",
      "the stretcher. \n",
      "‘Ah, God! My God! What is it? The stomach? That \n",
      "means death! My God!’- voi ces among the officers were \n",
      "heard saying. \n",
      "‘It flew a hair’s breadth past my ear,’ said the adjutant. \n",
      "The peasants, adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders, \n",
      "started hurriedly along the path they had trodden down, to \n",
      "the dressing station. \n",
      "‘Keep in step! Ah... those peasants!’ shouted an \n",
      "officer, seizing by their s houlders and checking the \n",
      "peasants, who were walking unevenly and jolting the \n",
      "stretcher. \n",
      "‘Get into step, Fedor... I say, Fedor!’ said the foremost \n",
      "peasant. \n",
      "‘Now that’s right!’ said the one behind joyfully, when \n",
      "he had got into step. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1911 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Your excellency! Eh, Prince!’ said the trembling \n",
      "voice of Timokhin, who had run up and was looking \n",
      "down on the stretcher. \n",
      "Prince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the \n",
      "speaker from the stretcher into which his head had sunk \n",
      "deep and again his eyelids drooped. \n",
      "The militiamen carried Prince Andrew to dressing \n",
      "station by the wood, where wagons were stationed. The \n",
      "dressing station consisted of th ree tents with flaps turned \n",
      "back, pitched at the edge of a birch wood. In the wood, \n",
      "wagons and horses were standi ng. The horses were eating \n",
      "oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down \n",
      "and pecked the grains that fell. Some crows, scenting \n",
      "blood, flew among the birch trees cawing impatiently. \n",
      "Around the tents, over more than  five acres, bloodstained \n",
      "men in various garbs stood, sat, or lay. Around the \n",
      "wounded stood crowds of soldie r stretcher-bearers with \n",
      "dismal and attentive faces, whom the officers keeping \n",
      "order tried in vain to drive from the spot. Disregarding the \n",
      "officers’ orders, the soldiers  stood leaning against their \n",
      "stretchers and gazing intentl y, as if trying to comprehend \n",
      "the difficult problem of what was taking place before \n",
      "them. From the tents came now loud angry cries and now \n",
      "plaintive groans. Occasionally dressers ran out to fetch \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1912 of 2882 \n",
      "water, or to point out thos e who were to be brought in \n",
      "next. The wounded men awaitin g their turn outside the \n",
      "tents groaned, sighed, wept, screamed, swore, or asked for \n",
      "vodka. Some were delirious. Pr ince Andrew’s bearers, \n",
      "stepping over the wounded who had not yet been \n",
      "bandaged, took him, as a regimental commander, close up \n",
      "to one of the tents a nd there stopped, awaiting \n",
      "instructions. Prince Andrew  opened his eyes and for a \n",
      "long time could not make out what was going on around \n",
      "him. He remembered the meadow, the wormwood, the \n",
      "field, the whirling black ball , and his sudden rush of \n",
      "passionate love of life. Two steps from him, leaning \n",
      "against a branch and talking loudly and attracting general \n",
      "attention, stood a tall, handsome, black-haired \n",
      "noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head. He had \n",
      "been wounded in the head and leg by bullets. Around him, \n",
      "eagerly listening to his ta lk, a crowd of wounded and \n",
      "stretcher-bearers was gathered. \n",
      "‘We kicked him out from there so that he chucked \n",
      "everything, we grabbed the King himself!’ cried he, \n",
      "looking around him with eyes that  glittered with fever. ‘If \n",
      "only reserves had come up just  then, lads, there wouldn’t \n",
      "have been nothing left of him! I tell you surely..’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1913 of 2882 \n",
      "Like all the others near the speaker, Prince Andrew \n",
      "looked at him with shining eyes and experienced a sense \n",
      "of comfort. ‘But isn’t it a ll the same now?’ thought he. \n",
      "‘And what will be there, and what has there been here? \n",
      "Why was I so reluctant to part with life? There was \n",

      "One of the doctors came out of the tent in a \n",
      "bloodstained apron, holding a cigar between the thumb \n",
      "and little finger of one of his small bloodstained hands, so \n",
      "as not to smear it. He rais ed his head and looked about \n",
      "him, but above the level of the wounded men. He \n",
      "evidently wanted a little respite. After turning his head \n",
      "from right to left for some  time, he sighed and looked \n",
      "down. \n",
      "‘All right, immediately,’ he replied to a dresser who \n",
      "pointed Prince Andrew out to him, and he told them to \n",
      "carry him into the tent. \n",
      "Murmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting. \n",
      "‘It seems that even in the next world only the gentry \n",
      "are to have a chance!’ remarked one. \n",
      "Prince Andrew was carried in and laid on a table that \n",
      "had only just been cleared and which a dresser was \n",
      "washing down. Prince Andrew could not make out \n",
      "distinctly what was in that tent. The pitiful groans from all \n",
      "sides and the torturing pain in his thigh, stomach, and \n",
      "back distracted him. All he saw about him merged into a \n",
      "general impression of naked, bleeding human bodies that \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1915 of 2882 \n",
      "seemed to fill the whole of the low tent, as a few weeks \n",
      "previously, on that hot August day, such bodies had filled \n",
      "the dirty pond beside the Smolensk road. Yes, it was the \n",
      "same flesh, the same chair a canon, the sight of which had \n",
      "even then filled him with horror, as by a presentiment. \n",
      "There were three operating tables in the tent. Two were \n",
      "occupied, and on the third th ey placed Prince Andrew. \n",
      "For a little while he was left alone and involuntarily \n",
      "witnessed what was taking place on the other two tables. \n",
      "On the nearest one sat a Tartar, probably a Cossack, \n",
      "judging by the uniform thrown down beside him. Four \n",
      "soldiers were holding him, and a spectacled doctor was \n",
      "cutting into his muscular brown back. \n",
      "‘Ooh, ooh, ooh!’ grunted the Tartar, and suddenly \n",
      "lifting up his swarthy snub- nosed face with its high \n",
      "cheekbones, and baring his wh ite teeth, he began to \n",
      "wriggle and twitch his body a nd utter piercing, ringing, \n",
      "and prolonged yells. On the other table, round which \n",
      "many people were crowding, a tall well-fed man lay on \n",
      "his back with his head thro wn back. His curly hair, its \n",
      "color, and the shape of his head seemed strangely familiar \n",
      "to Prince Andrew. Several dressers were pressing on his \n",
      "chest to hold him down. One large, white, plump leg \n",
      "twitched rapidly all the time with a feverish tremor. The War and Peace  \n",
      "1916 of 2882 \n",
      "man was sobbing and choking convulsively. Two doctors- \n",
      "one of whom was pale and trembling- were silently doing \n",
      "something to this man’s other, gory leg. When he had \n",
      "finished with the Tartar, whom they covered with an \n",
      "overcoat, the spectacled doctor came up to Prince \n",
      "Andrew, wiping his hands. \n",
      "He glanced at Prince Andrew’s face and quickly turned \n",
      "away. \n",
      "‘Undress him! What are you waiting for?’ he cried \n",
      "angrily to the dressers. \n",
      "His very first, remotest recollections of childhood \n",
      "came back to Prince Andrew’s mind when the dresser \n",
      "with sleeves rolled up began hastily to undo the buttons of \n",
      "his clothes and undressed him. The doctor bent down over \n",
      "the wound, felt it, and sighed deeply. Then he made a sign \n",
      "to someone, and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused \n",
      "Prince Andrew to lose cons ciousness. When he came to \n",
      "himself the splintered portions  of his thighbone had been \n",
      "extracted, the torn fles h cut away, and the wound \n",
      "bandaged. Water was being sprinkled on his face. As soon \n",
      "as Prince Andrew opened his eyes, the doctor bent over, \n",
      "kissed him silently on the lips, and hurried away. \n",
      "After the sufferings he had been enduring, Prince \n",
      "Andrew enjoyed a blissful feeling such as he had not \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1917 of 2882 \n",
      "experienced for a long time. All the best and happiest \n",
      "moments of his life- esp ecially his earliest childhood, \n",
      "when he used to be undresse d and put to bed, and when \n",
      "leaning over him his nurse sang him to sleep and he, \n",
      "burying his head in the pillow, felt happy in the mere \n",
      "consciousness of life- returned  to his memory, not merely \n",
      "as something past but as something present. \n",
      "The doctors were busily engaged with the wounded \n",
      "man the shape of whose head seemed familiar to Prince \n",
      "Andrew: they were lifting him up and trying to quiet him. \n",
      "‘Show it to me.... Oh, ooh... Oh! Oh, ooh!’ his \n",
      "frightened moans could be heard, subdued by suffering \n",
      "and broken by sobs. \n",
      "Hearing those moans Prince Andrew wanted Andrew \n",
      "wanted to weep. Whether because he was dying without \n",
      "glory, or because he was sorry to part with life, or because \n",
      "of those memories of a chil dhood that could not return, or \n",
      "because he was suffering and others were suffering and \n",
      "that man near him was groaning  so piteously- he felt like \n",
      "weeping childlike, kindly, and almost happy tears. \n",
      "The wounded man was shown his amputated leg \n",
      "stained with clotted blood and with the boot still on. \n",
      "‘Oh! Oh, ooh!’ he sobbed, like a woman. War and Peace  \n",
      "1918 of 2882 \n",
      "The doctor who had been standing beside him, \n",

      "away. \n",
      "‘My God! What is this? Why is he here?’ said Prince \n",
      "Andrew to himself. \n",
      "In the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man whose leg \n",
      "had just been amputated, he recognized Anatole Kuragin. \n",
      "Men were supporting him in their arms and offering him a \n",
      "glass of water, but his trem bling, swollen lips could not \n",
      "grasp its rim. Anatole was s obbing painfully. ‘Yes, it is \n",
      "he! Yes, that man is some how closely and painfully \n",
      "connected with me,’ thought  Prince Andrew, not yet \n",
      "clearly grasping what he saw before him. ‘What is the \n",
      "connection of that man with  my childhood and life?’ he \n",
      "asked himself without finding an answer. And suddenly a \n",
      "new unexpected memory from that realm of pure and \n",

      "Natasha as he had seen her for the first time at the ball in \n",
      "1810, with her slender neck and arms and with a \n",
      "frightened happy face ready for rapture, and love and \n",
      "tenderness for her, stronger and more vivid than ever, \n",
      "awoke in his soul. He now remembered the connection \n",

      "Dolokhov.’ And the memory of the dinner at the English \n",
      "Club when he had challenged Dolokhov flashed through \n",
      "Pierre’s mind, and then he remembered his benefactor at \n",
      "Torzhok. And now a picture of a solemn meeting of the \n",
      "lodge presented itself to hi s mind. It was taking place at \n",
      "the English Club and someone n ear and dear to him sat at \n",
      "the end of the table. ‘Yes, that  is he! It is my benefactor. \n",
      "But he died!’ thought Pierre. ‘Yes, he died, and I did not \n",
      "know he was alive. How sorry I am that he died, and how \n",
      "glad I am that he is alive again!’ On one side of the table \n",
      "sat Anatole, Dolokhov, Nesvits ki, Denisov, and others \n",
      "like them (in his dream the category to which these men \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1985 of 2882 \n",
      "belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the \n",
      "category of those he termed they), and he heard those \n",
      "people, Anatole and Dolokhov, shouting and singing \n",
      "loudly; yet through their shouting the voice of his \n",
      "benefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound \n",
      "of his words was as weighty and uninterrupted as the \n",
      "booming on the battlefield, but  pleasant and comforting. \n",
      "Pierre did not understand what his benefactor was saying, \n",
      "but he knew (the categories of thoughts were also quite \n",
      "distinct in his dream) that he was talking of goodness and \n",
      "the possibility of being what they were. And they with \n",
      "their simple, kind, firm faces surrounded his benefactor \n",
      "on all sides. But though they were kindly they did not \n",
      "look at Pierre and did not know him. Wishing to speak \n",
      "and to attract their attention, he got up, but at that moment \n",
      "his legs grew cold and bare. He felt ashamed, and with \n",
      "one arm covered his legs from which his cloak had in fact \n",
      "slipped. For a moment as he  was rearranging his cloak \n",
      "Pierre opened his eyes and sa w the same penthouse roofs, \n",
      "posts, and yard, but now they were all bluish, lit up, and \n",
      "glittering with frost or dew. \n",
      "‘It is dawn,’ thought Pierre . ‘But that’s not what I \n",
      "want. I want to hear and understand my benefactor’s \n",
      "words.’ Again he covered himself up with his cloak, but War and Peace  \n",
      "1986 of 2882 \n",
      "now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there. There \n",
      "were only thoughts clearly ex pressed in words, thoughts \n",
      "that someone was uttering or that he himself was \n",
      "formulating. \n",
      "Afterwards when he recalled those thoughts Pierre was \n",
      "convinced that someone outside himself had spoken them, \n",
      "though the impressions of that  day had evoked them. He \n",
      "had never, it seemed to him, been able to think and \n",
      "express his thoughts like that when awake. \n",
      "‘To endure war is the most difficult subordination of \n",
      "man’s freedom to the law of God,’ the voice had said. \n",
      "‘Simplicity is submission to the will of God; you cannot \n",
      "escape from Him. And they are simple. They do not talk, \n",
      "but act. The spoken word is silver but the unspoken is \n",
      "golden. Man can be master of nothing while he fears \n",
      "death, but he who does not fear  it possesses all. If there \n",
      "were no suffering, man would not know his limitations, \n",
      "would not know himself. The hardest thing [Pierre went \n",
      "on thinking, or hearing, in his dream] is to be able in your \n",
      "soul to unite the meaning of all. To unite all?’ he asked \n",
      "himself. ‘No, not to unite. Thoughts cannot be united, but \n",
      "to harness all these thoughts together is what we need! \n",
      "Yes, one must harness them, must harness them!’ he \n",
      "repeated to himself with inward  rapture, feeling that these \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1987 of 2882 \n",
      "words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say \n",
      "and solved the question that tormented him. \n",
      "‘Yes, one must harness, it is time to harness.’ \n",
      "‘Time to harness, time to  harness, your excellency! \n",
      "Your excellency!’ some voi ce was repeating. ‘We must \n",
      "harness, it is time to harness...’ \n",
      "It was the voice of the groom, trying to wake him. The \n",
      "sun shone straight into Pierre ’s face. He glanced at the \n",
      "dirty innyard in the middle of which soldiers were \n",
      "watering their lean horses at the pump while carts were \n",
      "passing out of the gate. Pi erre turned away with \n",
      "repugnance, and closing his eyes  quickly fell back on the \n",
      "carriage seat. ‘No, I don’t want  that, I don’t want to see \n",
      "and understand that. I want to understand what was \n",
      "revealing itself to me in my  dream. One second more and \n",
      "I should have understood it all!  But what am I to do? \n",
      "Harness, but how can I harne ss everything?’ and Pierre \n",
      "felt with horror that the mean ing of all he had seen and \n",
      "thought in the dream had been destroyed. \n",
      "The groom, the coachman, and the innkeeper told \n",
      "Pierre that an officer had come  with news that the French \n",
      "were already near Mozhaysk and that our men were \n",
      "leaving it. War and Peace  \n",
      "1988 of 2882 \n",
      "Pierre got up and, having to ld them to harness and \n",
      "overtake him, went on foot through the town. \n",
      "The troops were moving on, leaving about ten \n",
      "thousand wounded behind them. There were wounded in \n",
      "the yards, at the windows of the houses, and the streets \n",
      "were crowded with them. In the streets, around carts that \n",
      "were to take some of the wounded away, shouts, curses, \n",
      "and blows could be heard. Pierre offered the use of his \n",
      "carriage, which had overtaken him, to a wounded general \n",
      "he knew, and drove with him to Moscow. On the way \n",
      "Pierre was told of the death of his brother-in-law Anatole \n",
      "and of that of Prince Andrew. \n",

      "On the thirteenth of Augus t Pierre reached Moscow. \n",
      "Close to the gates of the city he was met by Count \n",

      "‘We have been looking for you everywhere,’ said the \n",
      "adjutant. ‘The count wants to see you particularly. He \n",
      "asks you to come to him at once on a very important \n",
      "matter.’ \n",
      "Without going home, Pierre took a cab and drove to \n",
      "see the Moscow commander in chief. \n",
      "Count Rostopchin had only that morning returned to \n",
      "town from his summer villa at Sokolniki. The anteroom \n",
      "and reception room of his house were full of officials who \n",
      "had been summoned or had co me for orders. Vasilchikov \n",
      "and Platov had already seen the count and explained to \n",
      "him that it was impossible to defend Moscow and that it \n",
      "would have to be surrendered. Though this news was \n",
      "being concealed from the inhabitants, the officials- the \n",
      "heads of the various government departments- knew that \n",
      "Moscow would soon be in the enemy’s hands, just as \n",
      "Count Rostopchin himself knew it, and to escape personal War and Peace  \n",
      "1990 of 2882 \n",
      "responsibility they had all co me to the governor to ask \n",
      "how they were to deal with their various departments. \n",
      "As Pierre was entering the reception room a courier \n",
      "from the army came out of Rostopchin’s private room. \n",
      "In answer to questions with  which he was greeted, the \n",
      "courier made a despairing gesture with his hand and \n",
      "passed through the room. \n",
      "While waiting in the recepti on room Pierre with weary \n",
      "eyes watched the various  officials, old and young, \n",
      "military and civilian, who were there. They all seemed \n",
      "dissatisfied and uneasy. Pierre went up to a group of men, \n",
      "one of whom he knew. Af ter greeting Pierre they \n",
      "continued their conversation. \n",
      "‘If they’re sent out and br ought back again later on it \n",
      "will do no harm, but as things are now one can’t answer \n",
      "for anything.’ \n",
      "‘But you see what he writes...’ said another, pointing to \n",
      "a printed sheet he held in his hand. \n",
      "‘That’s another matter. That’s necessary for the \n",
      "people,’ said the first. \n",
      "‘What is it?’ asked Pierre. \n",
      "‘Oh, it’s a fresh broadsheet.’ \n",
      "Pierre took it and began reading. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1991 of 2882 \n",
      "His Serene Highness has passed through Mozhaysk in \n",
      "order to join up with the troops moving toward him and \n",
      "has taken up a strong position where the enemy will not \n",
      "soon attack him. Forty eight guns with ammunition have \n",
      "been sent him from here, and his Serene Highness says he \n",
      "will defend Moscow to the last drop of blood and is even \n",
      "ready to fight in the streets. Do not be upset, brothers, that \n",
      "the law courts are closed; things  have to be put in order, \n",
      "and we will deal with villain s in our own way! When the \n",
      "time comes I shall want both town and peasant lads and \n",
      "will raise the cry a day or two beforehand, but they are \n",
      "not wanted yet so I hold my peace. An ax will be useful, a \n",
      "hunting spear not bad, but a three-pronged fork will be \n",
      "best of all: a Frenchman is no heavier than a sheaf of rye. \n",
      "Tomorrow after dinner I shall take the Iberian icon of the \n",
      "Mother of God to the wounde d in the Catherine Hospital \n",
      "where we will have some water blessed. That will help \n",

      "‘But military men have told me that it is impossible to \n",

      "‘Well, of course! That’s what we were saying,’ replied \n",
      "the first speaker. War and Peace  \n",
      "1992 of 2882 \n",
      "‘And what does he mean by ‘One of my eyes was sore \n",
      "but now I am on the lookout with both’?’ asked Pierre. \n",
      "‘The count had a sty,’ re plied the adjutant smiling, \n",
      "‘and was very much upset when I told him people had \n",
      "come to ask what was the matter with him. By the by, \n",
      "Count,’ he added suddenly, addressing Pierre with a \n",
      "smile, ‘we heard that you have family troubles and that \n",
      "the countess, your wife..’ \n",
      "‘I have heard nothing,’ Pie rre replied unconcernedly. \n",
      "‘But what have you heard?’ \n",
      "‘Oh, well, you know people often invent things. I only \n",
      "say what I heard.’ \n",
      "‘But what did you hear?’ \n",
      "‘Well, they say,’ continued the adjutant with the same \n",
      "smile, ‘that the countess, your wife, is preparing to go \n",
      "abroad. I expect it’s nonsense...’ \n",
      "‘Possibly,’ remarked Pierre, looking about him absent-\n",
      "mindedly. ‘And who is that?’ he asked, indicating a short \n",
      "old man in a clean blue peasant overcoat, with a big \n",
      "snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face. \n",
      "‘He? That’s a tradesman, that is to say, he’s the \n",
      "restaurant keeper, Vereshchagin. Perhaps you have heard \n",
      "of that affair with the proclamation.’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1993 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Oh, so that is Vereshchagin!’ said Pierre, looking at \n",
      "the firm, calm face of the old man and seeking any \n",
      "indication of his being a traitor. \n",
      "‘That’s not he himself, that’s the father of the fellow \n",
      "who wrote the proclamation,’ said the adjutant. ‘The \n",
      "young man is in prison and I exp ect it will go hard with \n",
      "him.’ \n",
      "An old gentleman wearing a star and another official, a \n",
      "German wearing a cross round his neck, approached the \n",
      "speaker. \n",
      "‘It’s a complicated story, you know,’ said the adjutant. \n",
      "‘That proclamation appeared about two months ago. The \n",
      "count was informed of it. He gave orders to investigate \n",
      "the matter. Gabriel Ivanovich  here made the inquiries. \n",
      "The proclamation had passed through exactly sixty-three \n",
      "hands. He asked one, ‘From whom did you get it?’ ‘From \n",
      "so-and-so.’ He went to the next one. ‘From whom did you \n",
      "get it?’ and so on till he r eached Vereshchagin, a half \n",
      "educated tradesman, you know, ‘a pet of a trader,’’ said \n",
      "the adjutant smiling. ‘They asked him, ‘Who gave it \n",
      "you?’ And the point is that we knew whom he had it \n",
      "from. He could only have had it from the Postmaster. But \n",
      "evidently they had come to some understanding. He \n",
      "replied: ‘From no one; I made it up myself.’ They War and Peace  \n",
      "1994 of 2882 \n",
      "threatened and questioned him, but he stuck to that: ‘I \n",
      "made it up myself.’ And so it was reported to the count, \n",
      "who sent for the man. ‘From whom did you get the \n",
      "proclamation?’ ‘I wrote it myself.’ Well, you know the \n",
      "count,’ said the adjutant cheerfully, with a smile of pride, \n",
      "‘he flared up dreadfully- and just think of the fellow’s \n",
      "audacity, lying, and obstinacy!’ \n",
      "‘And the count wanted him to say it was from \n",
      "Klyucharev? I understand!’ said Pierre. \n",
      "‘Not at all,’ rejoined the adjutant in dismay. \n",
      "‘Klyucharev had his own sins to answer for without that \n",
      "and that is why he has been banished. But the point is that \n",
      "the count was much annoyed. ‘How could you have \n",
      "written it yourself?’ said he, and he took up the Hamburg \n",
      "Gazette that was lying on the table. ‘Here it is! You did \n",
      "not write it yourself but transl ated it, and translated it \n",
      "abominably, because you don’t even know French, you \n",
      "fool.’ And what do you think?  ‘No,’ said he, ‘I have not \n",
      "read any papers, I made it up my self.’ ‘If that’s so, you’re \n",
      "a traitor and I’ll have you tried, and you’ll be hanged! Say \n",
      "from whom you had it.’ ‘I have seen no papers, I made it \n",
      "up myself.’ And that was the end of it. The count had the \n",
      "father fetched, but the fellow st uck to it. He was sent for \n",
      "trial and condemned to hard labor, I believe. Now the \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1995 of 2882 \n",
      "father has come to intercede for him. But he’s a good-for-\n",
      "nothing lad! You know that sort of tradesman’s son, a \n",
      "dandy and lady-killer. He attended some lectures \n",
      "somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match for \n",
      "him. That’s the sort of fellow he is. His father keeps a \n",
      "cookshop here by the Stone Bridge, and you know there \n",
      "was a large icon of God Almi ghty painted with a scepter \n",
      "in one hand and an orb in the other. Well, he took that \n",

      "In the middle of this fresh tale Pierre was summoned to \n",
      "the commander in chief. \n",
      "When he entered the privat e room Count Rostopchin, \n",
      "puckering his face, was rubbing his forehead and eyes \n",
      "with his hand. A short man was saying something, but \n",
      "when Pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out. \n",
      "‘Ah, how do you do, great warrior?’ said Rostopchin \n",
      "as soon as the short man had left the room. ‘We have \n",
      "heard of your prowess. But th at’s not the point. Between \n",
      "ourselves, mon cher, do you belong to the Masons?’ he \n",
      "went on severely, as though there were something wrong \n",
      "about it which he nevertheless intended to pardon. Pierre \n",
      "remained silent. ‘I am well informed, my friend, but I am \n",
      "aware that there are Masons and Masons and I hope that \n",
      "you are not one of those who on pretense of saving \n",
      "mankind wish to ruin Russia.’ \n",
      "‘Yes, I am a Mason,’ Pierre replied. \n",
      "‘There, you see, mon cher! I expect you know that \n",
      "Messrs. Speranski and Magnits ki have been deported to \n",
      "their proper place. Mr. Klyucharev has been treated in the \n",
      "same way, and so have others who on the plea of building \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1997 of 2882 \n",
      "up the temple of Solomon have tried to destroy the temple \n",
      "of their fatherland. You can  understand that there are \n",
      "reasons for this and that I could not have exiled the \n",
      "Postmaster had he not been a harmful person. It has now \n",
      "come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage for \n",
      "his removal from town, and that you have even accepted \n",
      "papers from him for safe custody. I like you and don’t \n",
      "wish you any harm and- as you are only half my age- I \n",
      "advise you, as a father woul d, to cease all communication \n",
      "with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as \n",

      "‘That is for me to know, but not for you to ask,’ \n",

      "‘If he is accused of circulating Napoleon’s \n",

      "without looking at Rostopchin, ‘and Vereshchagin..’ \n",
      "‘There we are!’ Rostopchin  shouted at Pierre louder \n",
      "than before, frowning suddenly. ‘Vereshchagin is a \n",

      "anybody’- but probably realizing that he was shouting at \n",
      "Bezukhov who so far was not guilty of anything, he \n",
      "added, taking Pierre’s hand in a friendly manner, ‘We are \n",
      "on the eve of a public disaster  and I haven’t time to be \n",
      "polite to everybody who has bus iness with me. My head \n",
      "is sometimes in a whirl. Well, mon cher, what are you \n",
      "doing personally?’ \n",
      "‘Why, nothing,’ answered Pie rre without raising his \n",
      "eyes or changing the thoughtful expression of his face. \n",
      "The count frowned. \n",
      "‘A word of friendly advice, mon cher. Be off as soon \n",

      "of the Society of Jesus?’ \n",
      "Pierre did not answer and le ft Rostopchin’s room more \n",
      "sullen and angry than he had ever before shown himself. \n",
      "When he reached home it was already getting dark. \n",
      "Some eight people had come to see him that evening: the \n",
      "secretary of a committee, the colonel of his battalion, his \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "1999 of 2882 \n",
      "steward, his major-domo, and various petitioners. They all \n",
      "had business with Pierre and wanted decisions from him. \n",
      "Pierre did not understand and was not interested in any of \n",
      "these questions and only answered them in order to get rid \n",
      "of these people. When left al one at last he opened and \n",
      "read his wife’s letter. \n",
      "‘They, the soldiers at th e battery, Prince Andrew \n",
      "killed... that old man... Simplicity is submission to God. \n",
      "Suffering is necessary... the meaning of all... one must \n",

      "on it without undressing and immediately fell asleep. \n",
      "When he awoke next morning the major-domo came to \n",
      "inform him that a special messenger, a police officer, had \n",

      "Bezukhov had left or was leaving the town. \n",
      "A dozen persons who had business with Pierre were \n",
      "awaiting him in the drawing room. Pierre dressed \n",

      "characteristic of all she did suddenly set to work too. At \n",
      "first her intervention in the business of packing was War and Peace  \n",
      "2016 of 2882 \n",
      "received skeptically. Ever ybody expected some prank \n",
      "from her and did not wish to obey her; but she resolutely \n",
      "and passionately demanded obedience, grew angry and \n",
      "nearly cried because they did not heed her, and at last \n",
      "succeeded in making them believe her. Her first exploit, \n",
      "which cost her immense effort and established her \n",
      "authority, was the packing of the carpets. The count had \n",
      "valuable Gobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in the \n",
      "house. When Natasha set to work two cases were standing \n",
      "open in the ballroom, one almost full up with crockery, \n",
      "the other with carpets. There was also much china \n",
      "standing on the tables, and still more was being brought in \n",
      "from the storeroom. A third case was needed and servants \n",
      "had gone to fetch it. \n",
      "‘Sonya, wait a bit- we’ll p ack everything into these,’ \n",
      "said Natasha. \n",
      "‘You can’t, Miss, we have tr ied to,’ said the butler’s \n",
      "assistant. \n",
      "‘No, wait a minute, please.’ \n",
      "And Natasha began rapidly taking out of the case \n",
      "dishes and plates wrapped in paper. \n",

      "she. \n",

      "2017 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Why, it’s a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into \n",
      "three cases,’ said the butler’s assistant. \n",
      "‘Oh, wait, please!’ And Natasha began rapidly and \n",
      "deftly sorting out the things. ‘These aren’t needed,’ said \n",
      "she, putting aside some plates of Kiev ware. ‘These- yes, \n",
      "these must go among the carpets,’ she said, referring to \n",
      "the Saxony china dishes. \n",
      "‘Don’t, Natasha! Leave it alone! We’ll get it all \n",
      "packed,’ urged Sonya reproachfully. \n",
      "‘What a young lady she is!’ remarked the major-domo. \n",
      "But Natasha would not give in. She turned everything \n",
      "out and began quickly rep acking, deciding that the \n",
      "inferior Russian carpets a nd unnecessary crockery should \n",
      "not be taken at all. When everything had been taken out of \n",
      "the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned out \n",
      "that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly \n",
      "all been rejected, the valuable ones really did all go into \n",
      "the two cases. Only the lid of the case containing the \n",
      "carpets would not shut down. A few more things might \n",
      "have been taken out, but Na tasha insisted on having her \n",
      "own way. She packed, repacked, pressed, made the \n",
      "butler’s assistant and Petya- whom she had drawn into the \n",
      "business of packing- press on the lid, and made desperate \n",
      "efforts herself. War and Peace  \n",
      "2018 of 2882 \n",
      "‘That’s enough, Natasha,’ said Sonya. ‘I see you were \n",
      "right, but just take out the top one.’ \n",
      "‘I won’t!’ cried Natasha, with one hand bolding back \n",
      "the hair that hung over her pers piring face, while with the \n",
      "other she pressed down the carp ets. ‘Now press, Petya! \n",
      "Press, Vasilich, press hard!’ she cried. \n",
      "The carpets yielded and the lid closed; Natasha, \n",
      "clapping her hands, screamed with delight and tears fell \n",

      "servants now came to her to ask whether a cart was \n",
      "sufficiently loaded, and whet her it might be corded up. \n",
      "Thanks to Natasha’s directi ons the work now went on \n",
      "expeditiously, unnecessary things  were left, and the most \n",

      "But hard as they all worked till quite late that night, \n",
      "they could not get everythi ng packed. The countess had \n",

      "Moscow’s last day had come. It was a clear bright \n",

      "Only two things indicated the social condition of \n",

      "He had nothing to do in Mo scow, but he had noticed \n",

      "worthy to do it justice! I tell you, Papa’ (he smote himself \n",

      "The countess, tired out and al ready dressed in shawl and \n",

      "At that moment this news had only one significance for \n",

      "‘Nothing,’ answered the c ountess. ‘If everything is \n",

      "Sonya sighed and made no reply. The count, Petya, \n",
      "Madame Schoss, Mavra Kuzminichna, and Vasilich came \n",
      "into the drawing room and, ha ving closed the doors, they \n",
      "all sat down and remained for some moments silently \n",

      "The count was the first to rise, and with a loud sigh \n",
      "crossed himself before the icon. All the others did the \n",

      "Vasilich, who were to remain in Moscow, and while they \n",
      "caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their \n",
      "backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and \n",
      "comforting words. The countess went into the oratory and \n",
      "there Sonya found her on her knees before the icons that \n",
      "had been left here and ther e hanging on the wall. (The \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2041 of 2882 \n",
      "most precious ones, with which some family tradition was \n",

      "armed with swords and dagge rs, with trousers tucked \n",
      "inside their high boots and with belts and girdles \n",
      "tightened, were taking leave of those remaining behind. \n",
      "As is always the case at a departure, much had been \n",
      "forgotten or put in the wr ong place, and for a long time \n",
      "two menservants stood one on each side of the open door \n",
      "and the carriage steps waiting to help the countess in, \n",
      "while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the \n",
      "house to the carriages, the ca leche, the phaeton, and back \n",
      "again. \n",
      "‘They always will forget everything!’ said the \n",
      "countess. ‘Don’t you know I can’t sit like that?’ \n",
      "And Dunyasha, with clenched teeth, without replying \n",
      "but with an aggrieved look on her face, hastily got into the \n",
      "coach to rearrange the seat. \n",
      "‘Oh, those servants!’ said the count, swaying his head. \n",
      "Efim, the old coachman, who was the only one the \n",
      "countess trusted to drive he r, sat perched up high on the \n",
      "box and did not so much as glance round at what was \n",
      "going on behind him. From thir ty years’ experience he \n",
      "knew it would be some time yet before the order, ‘Be off, War and Peace  \n",
      "2042 of 2882 \n",
      "in God’s name!’ would be given him: and he knew that \n",
      "even when it was said he would be stopped once or twice \n",
      "more while they sent back to fetch something that had \n",
      "been forgotten, and even after that he would again be \n",
      "stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the \n",
      "window and beg him for the love of heaven to drive \n",
      "carefully down the hill. He knew all this and therefore \n",
      "waited calmly for what would happen, with more patience \n",
      "than the horses, especially the near one, the chestnut \n",
      "Falcon, who was pawing the ground and champing his bit. \n",
      "At last all were seated, the carriage steps were folded and \n",
      "pulled up, the door was shut, somebody was sent for a \n",
      "traveling case, and the counte ss leaned out and said what \n",
      "she had to say. Then Efim deliberately doffed his hat and \n",
      "began crossing himself. The postilion and all the other \n",
      "servants did the same. ‘Off, in God’s name!’ said Efim, \n",
      "putting on his hat. ‘Start!’ The postilion started the horses, \n",
      "the off pole horse tugged at his collar, the high springs \n",
      "creaked, and the body of the coach swayed. The footman \n",
      "sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as \n",
      "it passed out of the yard onto the uneven roadway; the \n",
      "other vehicles jolted in thei r turn, and the procession of \n",
      "carriages moved up the street. In the carriages, the \n",
      "caleche, and the phaeton, all crossed themselves as they \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2043 of 2882 \n",
      "passed the church opposite the house. Those who were to \n",
      "remain in Moscow walked on e ither side of the vehicles \n",
      "seeing the travelers off. \n",
      "Rarely had Natasha experienced  so joyful a feeling as \n",
      "now, sitting in the carriage beside the countess and gazing \n",
      "at the slowly receding walls of forsaken, agitated \n",
      "Moscow. Occasionally she leaned out of the carriage \n",
      "window and looked back and th en forward at the long \n",
      "train of wounded in front of them. Almost at the head of \n",
      "the line she could see the ra ised hood of Prince Andrew’s \n",
      "caleche. She did not know who was in it, but each time \n",
      "she looked at the procession he r eyes sought that caleche. \n",

      "In Kudrino, from the Nikitski, Presnya, and \n",

      "similar to the Rostovs’, and as they passed along the \n",

      "2044 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Look! Yes, on my word, it’s Bezukhov!’ said \n",
      "Natasha, putting her head out of the carriage and staring \n",
      "at a tall, stout man in a coachman’s long coat, who from \n",
      "his manner of walking and moving was evidently a \n",
      "gentleman in disguise, a nd who was passing under the \n",
      "arch of the Sukharev tower accompanied by a small, \n",
      "sallow-faced, beardless old man in a frieze coat. \n",
      "‘Yes, it really is Bezukhov in a coachman’s coat, with \n",

      "down the street with head bent  and a serious face beside a \n",
      "small, beardless old man who looked like a footman. That \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2045 of 2882 \n",
      "said something to him and point ed to the carriage. Pierre, \n",

      "looked round at Natasha whose radiant, happy expression- \n",
      "of which he was conscious without looking at her- filled \n",
      "him with enchantment. \n",
      "‘Are you remaining in Moscow, then?’ \n",

      "From an unfinished house on the Varvarka, the ground \n",
      "floor of which was a dram shop, came drunken shouts and \n",
      "songs. On benches round the tabl es in a dirty little room \n",
      "sat some ten factory hands. Tipsy and perspiring, with \n",
      "dim eyes and wide-open mouths, they were all laboriously \n",
      "singing some song or other. They were singing \n",
      "discordantly, arduously, and w ith great effort, evidently \n",
      "not because they wished to sing, but because they wanted \n",
      "to show they were drunk and on a spree. One, a tall, fair-\n",
      "haired lad in a clean blue coat, was standing over the \n",
      "others. His face with its fine straight nose would have \n",
      "been handsome had it not been for his thin, compressed, \n",

      "possessed by some idea, he stood over those who were \n",
      "singing, and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their \n",
      "heads his white arm with the sleeve turned up to the \n",
      "elbow, trying unnaturally to sp read out his dirty fingers. \n",
      "The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he always \n",

      "most important that the sinewy white arm he was \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",

      "retreating to the Ryazan road beyond Moscow. This was \n",
      "not news to Rostopchin. He had known that Moscow \n",

      "previous day with Kutuzov on the Poklonny Hill but ever \n",
      "since the battle of Borodi no, for all the generals who \n",

      "he was then actuated by two important considerations: to \n",
      "maintain tranquillity in Moscow and expedite the \n",
      "departure of the inhabitants.  If one accepts this twofold \n",

      "Moscow became certain or at least probable, Rostopchin \n",

      "had grown so used to it, that the necessity of relinquishing \n",
      "that role and abandoning Moscow without any heroic \n",

      "The inhabitants left against his wishes. If the government \n",

      "balcony door, took hold of the handle, let it go again, and \n",
      "went to the window from which he had a better view of \n",
      "the whole crowd. The tall lad was standing in front, \n",
      "flourishing his arm and sayi ng something with a stern \n",
      "look. The blood stained smith stood beside him with a \n",
      "gloomy face. A drone of voices was audible through the \n",
      "closed window. War and Peace  \n",
      "2094 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Is my carriage ready?’ asked Rostopchin, stepping \n",
      "back from the window. \n",
      "‘It is, your excellency,’ replied the adjutant. \n",
      "Rostopchin went again to the balcony door. \n",
      "‘But what do they want?’ he asked the superintendent \n",
      "of police. \n",
      "‘Your excellency, they sa y they have got ready, \n",
      "according to your orders, to go against the French, and \n",
      "they shouted something about treachery. But it is a \n",
      "turbulent crowd, your excellency- I hardly managed to get \n",
      "away from it. Your excellency, I venture to suggest..’ \n",
      "‘You may go. I don’t need you to tell me what to do!’ \n",
      "exclaimed Rostopchin angrily. \n",
      "He stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd. \n",
      "‘This is what they have done with Russia! This is what \n",
      "they have done with me!’ thought he, full of an \n",
      "irrepressible fury that welled up within him against the \n",
      "someone to whom what was happening might be \n",
      "attributed. As often happens with passionate people, he \n",
      "was mastered by anger but wa s still seeking an object on \n",
      "which to vent it. ‘Here is that mob, the dregs of the \n",
      "people,’ he thought as he gazed at the crowd: ‘this rabble \n",
      "they have roused by their folly ! They want a victim,’ he \n",
      "thought as he looked at the ta ll lad flourishing his arm. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2095 of 2882 \n",
      "And this thought occurred to him just because he himself \n",
      "desired a victim, something on which to vent his rage. \n",
      "‘Is the carriage ready?’ he asked again. \n",
      "‘Yes, your excellency. What  are your orders about \n",
      "Vereshchagin? He is waiting at the porch,’ said the \n",
      "adjutant. \n",
      "‘Ah!’ exclaimed Rostopchin, as if struck by an \n",
      "unexpected recollection. \n",
      "And rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out \n",
      "onto the balcony. The talking instantly ceased, hats and \n",
      "caps were doffed, and all eyes were raised to the count. \n",
      "‘Good morning, lads!’ said the count briskly and \n",
      "loudly. ‘Thank you for coming. I’ll come out to you in a \n",
      "moment, but we must first settle with the villain. We must \n",
      "punish the villain who has caused the ruin of Moscow. \n",
      "Wait for me!’ \n",
      "And the count stepped as br iskly back into the room \n",
      "and slammed the door behind him. \n",
      "A murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through \n",
      "the crowd. ‘He’ll settle with all the villains, you’ll see! \n",
      "And you said the French... He’ll show you what law is!’ \n",
      "the mob were saying as if reproving one another for their \n",
      "lack of confidence. War and Peace  \n",
      "2096 of 2882 \n",
      "A few minutes later an offi cer came hurriedly out of \n",
      "the front door, gave an order, and the dragoons formed up \n",
      "in line. The crowd moved eagerly from the balcony \n",
      "toward the porch. Rostopchi n, coming out there with \n",
      "quick angry steps, looked hastily around as if seeking \n",
      "someone. \n",
      "‘Where is he?’ he inquired. And as he spoke he saw a \n",
      "young man coming round the corner of the house between \n",
      "two dragoons. He had a long thin neck, and his head, that \n",
      "had been half shaved, was again covered by short hair. \n",
      "This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth \n",
      "coat lined with fox fur, that had once been smart, and \n",
      "dirty hempen convict trousers, over which were pulled his \n",
      "thin, dirty, trodden-down boots. On his thin, weak legs \n",
      "were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute \n",
      "movements. \n",
      "‘Ah!’ said Rostopchin, hurriedly turning away his eyes \n",
      "from the young man in the fur-l ined coat and pointing to \n",
      "the bottom step of the porch. ‘Put him there.’ \n",
      "The young man in his clattering chains stepped \n",
      "clumsily to the spot indicat ed, holding away with one \n",
      "finger the coat collar which chafed his neck, turned his \n",
      "long neck twice this way and that, sighed, and \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2097 of 2882 \n",
      "submissively folded before him his thin hands, unused to \n",
      "work. \n",
      "For several seconds while the young man was taking \n",
      "his place on the step the silence continued. Only among \n",
      "the back rows of the people, who were all pressing toward \n",
      "the one spot, could sighs, groans , and the shuffling of feet \n",
      "be heard. \n",
      "While waiting for the young man to take his place on \n",
      "the step Rostopchin stood fr owning and rubbing his face \n",
      "with his hand. \n",
      "‘Lads!’ said he, with a metallic ring in his voice. ‘This \n",
      "man, Vereshchagin, is the scoundrel by whose doing \n",
      "Moscow is perishing.’ \n",
      "The young man in the fur-lined coat, stooping a little, \n",
      "stood in a submissive attitude , his fingers clasped before \n",
      "him. His emaciated young face, disfigured by the half-\n",
      "shaven head, hung down hopelessly. At the count’s first \n",
      "words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if \n",
      "wishing to say something or at least to meet his eye. But \n",
      "Rostopchin did not look at  him. A vein in the young \n",
      "man’s long thin neck swelled like a cord and went blue \n",
      "behind the ear, and suddenly his face flushed. \n",
      "All eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, \n",
      "and rendered more hopeful by the expression he read on War and Peace  \n",
      "2098 of 2882 \n",
      "the faces there, he smiled sadly and timidly, and lowering \n",
      "his head shifted his feet on the step. \n",
      "‘He has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he had gone \n",
      "over to Bonaparte. He alone  of all the Russians has \n",
      "disgraced the Russian name, he has caused Moscow to \n",
      "perish,’ said Rostopchin in  a sharp, even voice, but \n",
      "suddenly he glanced down at Vereshchagin who \n",
      "continued to stand in the same  submissive attitude. As if \n",
      "inflamed by the sight, he rais ed his arm and addressed the \n",
      "people, almost shouting: \n",
      "‘Deal with him as you thin k fit! I hand him over to \n",
      "you.’ \n",
      "The crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and \n",
      "closer to one another. To keep one another back, to \n",
      "breathe in that stifling atmosphere, to be unable to stir, \n",
      "and to await something unknown, uncomprehended, and \n",
      "terrible, was becoming unbearable. Those standing in \n",
      "front, who had seen and h eard what had taken place \n",
      "before them, all stood with wide open eyes and mouths, \n",
      "straining with all their stre ngth, and held back the crowd \n",
      "that was pushing behind them. \n",
      "‘Beat him!... Let the traitor perish and not disgrace the \n",
      "Russian name!’ shouted Rostopchin. ‘Cut him down. I \n",
      "command it.’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2099 of 2882 \n",
      "Hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of \n",
      "Rostopchin’s voice, the crowd moaned and heaved \n",
      "forward, but again paused. \n",
      "‘Count!’ exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of \n",
      "Vereshchagin in the midst of the momentary silence that \n",
      "ensued, ‘Count! One God is above us both....’ He lifted \n",
      "his head and again the thick vein in his thin neck filled \n",
      "with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his \n",
      "face. \n",
      "He did not finish what he wished to say. \n",
      "‘Cut him down! I command it...’ shouted Rostopchin, \n",
      "suddenly growing pale like Vereshchagin. \n",
      "‘Draw sabers!’ cried the dr agoon officer, drawing his \n",
      "own. \n",
      "Another still stronger wave  flowed through the crowd \n",
      "and reaching the front ranks carried it swaying to the very \n",
      "steps of the porch. The tall youth, with a stony look on his \n",
      "face, and rigid and uplifted arm, stood beside \n",
      "Vereshchagin. \n",
      "‘Saber him!’ the dragoon officer almost whispered. \n",
      "And one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted \n",
      "with fury, struck Vereshchagin on the head with the blunt \n",
      "side of his saber. War and Peace  \n",
      "2100 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Ah!’ cried Vereshchagin in meek surprise, looking \n",
      "round with a frightened glance as if not understanding \n",
      "why this was done to him. A similar moan of surprise and \n",
      "horror ran through the crowd. ‘O Lord!’ exclaimed a \n",
      "sorrowful voice. \n",
      "But after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped \n",
      "from Vereshchagin he uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and \n",
      "that cry was fatal. The barrier of human feeling, strained \n",
      "to the utmost, that had held the crowd in check suddenly \n",
      "broke. The crime had begun and must now be completed. \n",
      "The plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the \n",
      "threatening and angry roar of  the crowd. Like the seventh \n",
      "and last wave that shatters a ship, that last irresistible \n",
      "wave burst from the rear an d reached the front ranks, \n",
      "carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all. The \n",
      "dragoon was about to repeat hi s blow. Vereshchagin with \n",
      "a cry of horror, covering his head with his hands, rushed \n",
      "toward the crowd. The tall youth, against whom he \n",
      "stumbled, seized his thin neck with his hands and, yelling \n",
      "wildly, fell with him under th e feet of the pressing, \n",
      "struggling crowd. \n",
      "Some beat and tore at Vereshchagin, others at the tall \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2101 of 2882 \n",
      "increased the fury of the crowd. It was a long time before \n",

      "almost to death. And for a l ong time, despite the feverish \n",

      "been begun, those who were hitting, throttling, and \n",
      "tearing at Vereshchagin were unable to kill him, for the \n",
      "crowd pressed from all sides,  swaying as one mass with \n",
      "them in the center and rendering it impossible for them \n",
      "either to kill him or let him go. \n",
      "‘Hit him with an ax, eh!... Crushed?... Traitor, he sold \n",
      "Christ.... Still alive... tenacious... serves him right! Torture \n",

      "Only when the victim ceased  to struggle and his cries \n",

      "2102 of 2882 \n",

      "stained with blood and dust. \n",
      "A painstaking police officer, considering the presence \n",
      "of a corpse in his excellenc y’s courtyard unseemly, told \n",
      "the dragoons to take it away. Two dragoons took it by its \n",
      "distorted legs and dragged it along the ground. The gory, \n",
      "dust-stained, half-shaven head  with its long neck trailed \n",
      "twisting along the ground. The crowd shrank back from it. \n",

      "with hurried steps and bent head, not knowing where and \n",
      "why, along the passage lead ing to the rooms on the \n",
      "ground floor. The count’s face was white and he could not \n",
      "control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw. \n",
      "‘This way, your excellency... Where are you going?... \n",
      "This way, please...’ said a trembling, frightened voice \n",
      "behind him. \n",
      "Count Rostopchin was unabl e to reply and, turning \n",
      "obediently, went in the direc tion indicated. At the back \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2103 of 2882 \n",
      "crowd was audible even there. He hastily took his seat \n",
      "and told the coachman to drive him to his country house \n",
      "in Sokolniki. \n",
      "When they reached the Myasnitski Street and could no \n",
      "longer hear the shouts of th e mob, the count began to \n",
      "repent. He remembered with dissatisfaction the agitation \n",

      "mob is terrible- disgusting,’ he said to himself in French. \n",
      "‘They are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can \n",

      "Vereshchagin’s words suddenly recurred to him, and a \n",
      "disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this was only \n",
      "a momentary feeling and Count Rostopchin smiled \n",
      "disdainfully at himself. ‘I  had other duties,’ thought he. \n",
      "‘The people had to be appeased. Many other victims have \n",
      "perished and are perishing for the public good’- and he \n",
      "began thinking of his social duties to his family and to the \n",

      "Theodore Vasilyevich Rostopchin (he fancied that \n",
      "Theodore Vasilyevich Rostopchin was sacrificing himself \n",
      "for the public good) but himself as governor, the \n",

      "Lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage \n",
      "and no longer hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, \n",
      "Rostopchin grew physically calm and, as always happens, \n",
      "as soon as he became physically tranquil his mind devised \n",
      "reasons why he should be me ntally tranquil too. The \n",
      "thought which tranquillized Rostopchin was not a new \n",

      "another no one has ever committed such a crime against \n",
      "his fellow man without comforting himself with this same \n",

      "To a man not swayed by passi on that welfare is never \n",
      "certain, but he who commits such a crime always knows \n",
      "just where that welfare lies. And Rostopchin now knew it. \n",
      "Not only did his reason not reproach him for what he \n",
      "had done, but he even found cause  for self-satisfaction in \n",
      "having so successfully contrived to avail himself of a \n",

      "same time pacify the mob. \n",
      "‘Vereshchagin was tried and condemned to death,’ \n",

      "Half an hour later he was dr iving with his fast horses \n",
      "across the Sokolniki field, no longer thinking of what had \n",

      "Kutuzov was. Count Rostopchi n was mentally preparing \n",

      "that would follow the abandonment of the city and the \n",
      "ruin of Russia (as Rostopchin regarded it) would fall upon \n",
      "his doting old head. Planning beforehand what he would \n",
      "say to Kutuzov, Rostopchin tu rned angrily in his caleche \n",
      "and gazed sternly from side to side. \n",
      "The Sokolniki field was deserted. Only at the end of it, \n",

      "One of these was running to cross the path of Count \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2123 of 2882 \n",
      "on the twenty-fifth and to make his way to the very thick \n",
      "of the battle and had now caused him to run away from \n",
      "his home and, in place of the luxury and comfort to which \n",
      "he was accustomed, to sleep on a hard sofa without \n",
      "undressing and eat the same food as Gerasim. The other \n",
      "was that vague and quite Russi an feeling of contempt for \n",
      "everything conventional, ar tificial, and human- for \n",
      "everything the majority of men regard as the greatest \n",
      "good in the world. Pierre ha d first experienced this \n",
      "strange and fascinating feeling at the Sloboda Palace, \n",
      "when he had suddenly felt that wealth, power, and life- all \n",
      "that men so painstakingly acqui re and guard- if it has any \n",
      "worth has so only by reason the joy with which it can all \n",

      "2124 of 2882 \n",
      "continuously under its influence, but only now found full \n",
      "satisfaction for it. Moreover, at this moment Pierre was \n",
      "supported in his design and pr evented from renouncing it \n",
      "by what he had already done in that direction. If he were \n",
      "now to leave Moscow like ev eryone else, his flight from \n",

      "to the Rostovs that he would remain in Moscow would all \n",
      "become not merely meaningless but contemptible and \n",
      "ridiculous, and to this Pierre was very sensitive. \n",
      "Pierre’s physical condition, as is always the case, \n",
      "corresponded to his mental  state. The unaccustomed \n",
      "coarse food, the vodka he dr ank during those days, the \n",
      "absence of wine and cigars , his dirty unchanged linen, \n",
      "two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without \n",
      "bedding- all this kept him in a state of excitement \n",
      "bordering on insanity. \n",
      "It was two o’clock in the afternoon. The French had \n",
      "already entered Moscow. Pierre  knew this, but instead of \n",
      "acting he only thought about his undertaking, going over \n",
      "its minutest details in his mi nd. In his fancy he did not \n",
      "clearly picture to himself either the striking of the blow or \n",
      "the death of Napoleon, but w ith extraordinary vividness \n",
      "and melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction \n",

      "2125 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Yes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it or perish!’ \n",
      "he thought. ‘Yes, I will appr oach... and then suddenly... \n",
      "with pistol or dagger? But that is all the same! ‘It is not I \n",
      "but the hand of Providence that punishes thee,’ I shall \n",
      "say,’ thought he, imagining what he would say when \n",
      "killing Napoleon. ‘Well then, take me and execute me!’ \n",
      "he went on, speaking to himself and bowing his head with \n",
      "a sad but firm expression. \n",
      "While Pierre, standing in the middle of the room, was \n",
      "talking to himself in this way, the study door opened and \n",
      "on the threshold appeared the figure of Makar \n",
      "Alexeevich, always so timid before but now quite \n",
      "transformed. \n",
      "His dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and \n",
      "distorted. He was obviously drunk. On seeing Pierre he \n",
      "grew confused at first, but noticing embarrassment on \n",
      "Pierre’s face immediately gr ew bold and, staggering on \n",
      "his thin legs, advanced into the middle of the room. \n",
      "‘They’re frightened,’ he said confidentially in a hoarse \n",
      "voice. ‘I say I won’t surrender, I say... Am I not right, \n",
      "sir?’ \n",
      "He paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the \n",
      "table seized it with unexpected rapidity and ran out into \n",
      "the corridor. War and Peace  \n",
      "2126 of 2882 \n",
      "Gerasim and the porter, who had followed Makar \n",
      "Alexeevich, stopped him in the vestibule and tried to take \n",
      "the pistol from him. Pierre, coming out into the corridor, \n",
      "looked with pity and repulsion at the half-cra zy old man. \n",
      "Makar Alexeevich, frowning with exertion, held on to the \n",
      "pistol and screamed hoarsely, evidently with some heroic \n",
      "fancy in his head. \n",
      "‘To arms! Board them! No, you shan’t get it,’ he \n",
      "yelled. \n",
      "‘That will do, please, that will do. Have the goodness- \n",
      "please, sir, to let go! Please, sir...’ pleaded Gerasim, trying \n",
      "carefully to steer Makar Alexeevich by the elbows back to \n",
      "the door. \n",
      "‘Who are you? Bonaparte!...’ shouted Makar \n",
      "Alexeevich. \n",
      "‘That’s not right, sir. Come to your room, please, and \n",
      "rest. Allow me to have the pistol.’ \n",
      "‘Be off, thou base slave! Touch me not! See this?’ \n",
      "shouted Makar Alexeevich, brandishing the pistol. ‘Board \n",

      "‘Catch hold!’ whispered Gerasim to the porter. \n",
      "They seized Makar Alexeevich by the arms and \n",

      "2127 of 2882 \n",
      "The vestibule was filled with  the discordant sounds of \n",
      "a struggle and of a tipsy, hoarse voice. \n",
      "Suddenly a fresh sound, a piercing feminine scream, \n",
      "reverberated from the po rch and the cook came running \n",
      "into the vestibule. \n",
      "‘It’s them! Gracious heavens! O Lord, four of them, \n",
      "horsemen!’ she cried. \n",
      "Gerasim and the porter le t Makar Alexeevich go, and \n",
      "in the now silent corridor the sound of several hands \n",
      "knocking at the front door could be heard. \n",

      "2128 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XXVIII \n",
      "Pierre, having decided that until he had carried out his \n",
      "design he would disclose ne ither his identity nor his \n",
      "knowledge of French, stood at the half-open door of the \n",
      "corridor, intending to conceal  himself as soon as the \n",
      "French entered. But the French entered and still Pierre did \n",
      "not retire- an irresistible curiosity kept him there. \n",
      "There were two of them. One was an officer- a tall, \n",
      "soldierly, handsome man- the ot her evidently a private or \n",
      "an orderly, sunburned, short, and thin, with sunken cheeks \n",
      "and a dull expression. The officer walked in front, leaning \n",
      "on a stick and slightly limping. When he had advanced a \n",
      "few steps he stopped, having  apparently decided that \n",
      "these were good quarters, turned round to the soldiers \n",
      "standing at the entrance, a nd in a loud voice of command \n",
      "ordered them to put up the horses. Having done that, the \n",
      "officer, lifting his elbow with a smart gesture, stroked his \n",
      "mustache and lightly touched his hat. \n",
      "‘Bonjour, la compagnie!’* said he gaily, smiling and \n",
      "looking about him. \n",
      "*\"Good day, everybody!’ \n",
      "No one gave any reply. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2129 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Vous etes le bourgeois?’* the officer asked Gerasim. \n",
      "*\"Are you the master here?’ \n",
      "Gerasim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and \n",
      "inquiring look. \n",
      "‘Quartier, quartier, logement!’ said the officer, looking \n",
      "down at the little man with a condescending and good-\n",
      "natured smile. ‘Les francais sont de bons enfants. Que \n",
      "diable! Voyons! Ne nous f achons pas, mon vieux!’* \n",
      "added he, clapping the scared and silent Gerasim on the \n",
      "shoulder. ‘Well, does no one speak French in this \n",
      "establishment?’ he asked again in French, looking around \n",
      "and meeting Pierre’s eyes. Pierre moved away from the \n",
      "door. \n",
      "*\"Quarters, quarters, lodgi ngs! The French are good \n",
      "fellows. What the devil! There,  don’t let us be cross, old \n",
      "fellow!’ \n",
      "Again the officer turned to Gerasim and asked him to \n",
      "show him the rooms in the house. \n",
      "‘Master, not here- don’t understand... me, you...’ said \n",
      "Gerasim, trying to render his words more comprehensible \n",
      "by contorting them. \n",
      "Still smiling, the French officer spread out his hands \n",
      "before Gerasim’s nose, intimating that he did not \n",
      "understand him either, and m oved, limping, to the door at War and Peace  \n",
      "2130 of 2882 \n",
      "which Pierre was standing. Pier re wished to go away and \n",
      "conceal himself, but at that moment he saw Makar \n",
      "Alexeevich appearing at the open kitchen door with the \n",
      "pistol in his hand. With a madman’s cunning, Makar \n",
      "Alexeevich eyed the Frenchman, raised his pistol, and \n",
      "took aim. \n",
      "‘Board them!’ yelled the tipsy man, trying to press the \n",
      "trigger. Hearing the yell the officer turned round, and at \n",
      "the same moment Pierre th rew himself on the drunkard. \n",
      "Just when Pierre snatched at and struck up the pistol \n",
      "Makar Alexeevich at last got his fingers on the trigger, \n",
      "there was a deafening report, and all were enveloped in a \n",
      "cloud of smoke. The Frenchman turned pale and rushed to \n",
      "the door. \n",
      "Forgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of \n",
      "French, Pierre, snatching away  the pistol and throwing it \n",
      "down, ran up to the officer and addressed him in French. \n",
      "‘You are not wounded?’ he asked. \n",
      "‘I think not,’ answered the Frenchman, feeling himself \n",
      "over. ‘But I have had a lucky escape this time,’ he added, \n",
      "pointing to the damaged plaster of the wall. ‘Who is that \n",
      "man?’ said he, looking sternly at Pierre. \n",
      "‘Oh, I am really in despair at  what has occurred,’ said \n",
      "Pierre rapidly, quite forgetting the part he had intended to \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2131 of 2882 \n",
      "play. ‘He is an unfortunate  madman who did not know \n",
      "what he was doing.’ \n",
      "The officer went up to Makar Alexeevich and took him \n",
      "by the collar. \n",
      "Makar Alexeevich was standing with parted lips, \n",
      "swaying, as if about to fall asleep, as he leaned against the \n",
      "wall. \n",
      "‘Brigand! You shall pay for this,’ said the Frenchman, \n",
      "letting go of him. ‘We French are merciful after victory, \n",
      "but we do not pardon traitors,’  he added, with a look of \n",
      "gloomy dignity and a fine energetic gesture. \n",
      "Pierre continued, in French, to persuade the officer not \n",
      "to hold that drunken imbecile  to account. The Frenchman \n",
      "listened in silence with the same gloomy expression, but \n",
      "suddenly turned to Pierre with a smile. For a few seconds \n",
      "he looked at him in silence. His handsome face assumed a \n",
      "melodramatically gentle expression and he held out his \n",
      "hand. \n",
      "‘You have saved my life. You are French,’ said he. \n",
      "For a Frenchman that deduction was indubitable. Only \n",
      "a Frenchman could perform a great deed, and to save his \n",
      "life- the life of M. Ramballe, captain of the 13th Light \n",
      "Regiment- was undoubtedly a very great deed. War and Peace  \n",
      "2132 of 2882 \n",
      "But however indubitable th at conclusion and the \n",
      "officer’s conviction based upon it, Pierre felt it necessary \n",
      "to disillusion him. \n",
      "‘I am Russian,’ he said quickly. \n",
      "‘Tut, tut, tut! Tell that to others,’ said the officer, \n",
      "waving his finger before his nose and smiling. ‘You shall \n",
      "tell me all about that presen tly. I am delighted to meet a \n",
      "compatriot. Well, and what are we to do with this man?’ \n",
      "he added, addressing himself to Pierre as to a brother. \n",
      "Even if Pierre were not a Frenchman, having once \n",
      "received that loftiest of hu man appellations he could not \n",
      "renounce it, said the officer’s look and tone. In reply to \n",
      "his last question Pierre again explained who Makar \n",
      "Alexeevich was and how just before their arrival that \n",
      "drunken imbecile had seized th e loaded pistol which they \n",
      "had not had time to recover from him, and begged the \n",
      "officer to let the deed go unpunished. \n",
      "The Frenchman expanded his chest and made a \n",
      "majestic gesture with his arm. \n",
      "‘You have saved my life! You are French. You ask his \n",
      "pardon? I grant it you. Lead that man away!’ said he \n",
      "quickly and energetically, and taking the arm of Pierre \n",
      "whom he had promoted to be a Frenchman for saving his \n",
      "life, he went with him into the room. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2133 of 2882 \n",
      "The soldiers in the yard, hearing the shot, came into \n",
      "the passage asking what ha d happened, and expressed \n",
      "their readiness to punish th e culprits, but the officer \n",
      "sternly checked them. \n",
      "‘You will be called in when you are wanted,’ he said. \n",
      "The soldiers went out again, and the orderly, who had \n",
      "meanwhile had time to visit the kitchen, came up to his \n",
      "officer. \n",
      "‘Captain, there is soup and a leg of mutton in the \n",
      "kitchen,’ said he. ‘Shall I serve them up?’ \n",

      "When the French officer went into the room with \n",
      "Pierre the latter ag ain thought it his dut y to assure him \n",
      "that he was not French and wished to go away, but the \n",
      "officer would not hear of it.  He was so very polite, \n",
      "amiable, good-natured, and genuinely grateful to Pierre \n",
      "for saving his life that Pierre  had not the heart to refuse, \n",
      "and sat down with him in the parlor- the first room they \n",

      "Frenchman, the captain, evidently not understanding how \n",
      "anyone could decline so flattering an appellation, \n",
      "shrugged his shoulders and said that if Pierre absolutely \n",

      "‘I have been in Paris. I spent years there,’ said Pierre. \n",
      "‘Oh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris!... A man who \n",
      "doesn’t know Paris is a savage. You can tell a Parisian \n",
      "two leagues off. Paris is Talm a, la Duchenois, Potier, the \n",
      "Sorbonne, the boulevards,’ and noticing that his \n",
      "conclusion was weaker than what had gone before, he \n",
      "added quickly: ‘There is only one Paris in the world. You \n",
      "have been to Paris and have remained Russian. Well, I \n",
      "don’t esteem you the less for it.’ \n",
      "Under the influence of the wine he had drunk, and after \n",
      "the days he had spent alone with his depressing thoughts, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2140 of 2882 \n",
      "Pierre involuntarily enjoyed talking with this cheerful and \n",
      "good-natured man. \n",
      "‘To return to your ladies- I hear they are lovely. What \n",
      "a wretched idea to go and bury themselves in the steppes \n",
      "when the French army is in Moscow. What a chance those \n",
      "girls have missed! Your p easants, now- that’s another \n",
      "thing; but you civilized pe ople, you ought to know us \n",
      "better than that. We took Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, \n",
      "Rome, Warsaw, all the world’s capitals.... We are feared, \n",
      "but we are loved. We are nice to know. And then the \n",
      "Emperor...’ he began, but Pierre interrupted him. \n",
      "‘The Emperor,’ Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly \n",
      "became sad and embarrassed, ‘is the Emperor...?’ \n",
      "‘The Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, justice, order, \n",
      "genius- that’s what the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who \n",
      "tell you so.... I assure you I was his enemy eight years \n",
      "ago. My father was an emigrant count.... But that man has \n",
      "vanquished me. He has taken hold of me. I could not \n",
      "resist the sight of the grande ur and glory with which he \n",
      "has covered France. When I understood what he wanted- \n",
      "when I saw that he was prepar ing a bed of laurels for us, \n",
      "you know, I said to myself: ‘That is a monarch,’ and I \n",
      "devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes, mon cher, he is \n",
      "the greatest man of the ages past or future.’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2141 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Is he in Moscow?’ Pierre  stammered with a guilty \n",
      "look. \n",
      "The Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled. \n",
      "‘No, he will make his entry tomorrow,’ he replied, and \n",
      "continued his talk. \n",
      "Their conversation was interrupted by the cries of \n",
      "several voices at the gate and by Morel, who came to say \n",
      "that some Wurttemberg hussars had come and wanted to \n",
      "put up their horses in the yard  where the captain’s horses \n",
      "were. This difficulty had arisen chiefly because the \n",
      "hussars did not understand what  was said to them in \n",
      "French. \n",
      "The captain had their senior sergeant called in, and in a \n",
      "stern voice asked him to what  regiment he belonged, who \n",
      "was his commanding officer, and by what right he \n",
      "allowed himself to claim quarters that were already \n",
      "occupied. The German who knew little French, answered \n",
      "the two first questions by giving the names of his \n",
      "regiment and of his commandi ng officer, but in reply to \n",
      "the third question which he  did not understand said, \n",
      "introducing broken French into  his own German, that he \n",
      "was the quartermaster of the regiment and his commander \n",
      "had ordered him to occupy all the houses one after \n",
      "another. Pierre, who knew Ge rman, translated what the War and Peace  \n",
      "2142 of 2882 \n",
      "German said to the captain and gave the captain’s reply to \n",
      "the Wurttemberg hussar in German. When he had \n",
      "understood what was said to him, the German submitted \n",
      "and took his men elsewhere. The captain went out into the \n",
      "porch and gave some orders in a loud voice. \n",
      "When he returned to the room Pierre was sitting in the \n",
      "same place as before, with his head in his hands. His face \n",
      "expressed suffering. He really was suffering at that \n",
      "moment. When the captain we nt out and he was left \n",
      "alone, suddenly he came to himself and realized the \n",
      "position he was in. It was not that Moscow had been taken \n",
      "or that the happy conquerors we re masters in it and were \n",
      "patronizing him. Painful as that was it was not that which \n",
      "tormented Pierre at the moment. He was tormented by the \n",
      "consciousness of his own weakness. The few glasses of \n",
      "wine he had drunk and the conversation with this good-\n",
      "natured man had destroyed the mood of concentrated \n",
      "gloom in which he had spent the last few days and which \n",
      "was essential for the execution of his design. The pistol, \n",
      "dagger, and peasant coat were ready. Napoleon was to \n",
      "enter the town next day. Pierre still considered that it \n",
      "would be a useful and worthy action to slay the evildoer, \n",
      "but now he felt that he woul d not do it. He did not know \n",
      "why, but he felt a foreboding that he would not carry out \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2143 of 2882 \n",
      "his intention. He struggled against the confession of his \n",
      "weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and \n",
      "that his former gloomy fr ame of mind, concerning \n",
      "vengeance, killing, and self-sac rifice, had been dispersed \n",
      "like dust by contact with the first man he met. \n",
      "The captain returned to the room, limping slightly and \n",
      "whistling a tune. \n",
      "The Frenchman’s chatter which had previously amused \n",
      "Pierre now repelled him. The tune he was whistling, his \n",
      "gait, and the gesture with wh ich he twirled his mustache, \n",
      "all now seemed offensive. ‘I will go away immediately. I \n",
      "won’t say another word to  him,’ thought Pierre. He \n",
      "thought this, but still sat in  the same place. A strange \n",
      "feeling of weakness tied him to the spot; he wished to get \n",
      "up and go away, but could not do so. \n",
      "The captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful. \n",
      "He paced up and down the room twice. His eyes shone \n",
      "and his mustache twitched as if he were smiling to \n",
      "himself at some amusing thought. \n",
      "‘The colonel of those Wurttembergers is delightful,’ he \n",
      "suddenly said. ‘He’s a German, but a nice fellow all the \n",
      "same.... But he’s a German.’ He sat down facing Pierre. \n",
      "‘By the way, you know German, then?’ \n",
      "Pierre looked at him in silence. War and Peace  \n",
      "2144 of 2882 \n",
      "‘What is the German for ‘shelter’?’ \n",
      "‘Shelter?’ Pierre repeated. ‘The German for shelter is \n",
      "Unterkunft.’ \n",
      "‘How do you say it?’ the captain asked quickly and \n",
      "doubtfully. \n",
      "‘Unterkunft,’ Pierre repeated. \n",
      "‘Onterkoff,’ said the captain and looked at Pierre for \n",
      "some seconds with laughing eyes. ‘These Germans are \n",
      "first-rate fools, don’t you thi nk so, Monsieur Pierre?’ he \n",
      "concluded. \n",
      "‘Well, let’s have anothe r bottle of this Moscow \n",
      "Bordeaux, shall we? Morel will wa rm us up another little \n",
      "bottle. Morel!’ he called out gaily. \n",
      "Morel brought candles a nd a bottle of wine. The \n",
      "captain looked at Pierre by the candlelight and was \n",
      "evidently struck by the troubled expression on his \n",
      "companion’s face. Ramballe, with genuine distress and \n",
      "sympathy in his face, went up to Pierre and bent over him. \n",
      "‘There now, we’re sad,’ said he, touching Pierre’s \n",
      "hand. ‘Have I upset you? No, re ally, have you anything \n",
      "against me?’ he asked Pierre. ‘Perhaps it’s the state of \n",
      "affairs?’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2145 of 2882 \n",
      "Pierre did not answer, but looked cordially into the \n",
      "Frenchman’s eyes whose expression of sympathy was \n",
      "pleasing to him. \n",
      "‘Honestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel \n",
      "friendship for you. Can I do anything for you? Dispose of \n",
      "me. It is for life and death. I say it with my hand on my \n",
      "heart!’ said he, striking his chest. \n",
      "‘Thank you,’ said Pierre. \n",
      "The captain gazed intently at him as he had done when \n",
      "he learned that ‘shelter’ was Unterkunft in German, and \n",
      "his face suddenly brightened. \n",
      "‘Well, in that case, I drink to our friendship!’ he cried \n",
      "gaily, filling two glasses with wine. \n",
      "Pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it. Ramballe \n",
      "emptied his too, again presse d Pierre’s hand, and leaned \n",
      "his elbows on the table in a pensive attitude. \n",
      "‘Yes, my dear friend,’ he began, ‘such is fortune’s \n",
      "caprice. Who would have said that I should be a soldier \n",
      "and a captain of dragoons in the service of Bonaparte, as \n",
      "we used to call him? Yet here I am in Moscow with him. I \n",
      "must tell you, mon cher,’ he  continued in the sad and \n",
      "measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story, \n",
      "‘that our name is one of the most ancient in France.’ War and Peace  \n",
      "2146 of 2882 \n",
      "And with a Frenchman’s easy and naive frankness the \n",
      "captain told Pierre the story of his ancestors, his \n",
      "childhood, youth, and manhood,  and all about his \n",
      "relations and his financial an d family affairs, ‘ma pauvre \n",
      "mere’ playing of course an important part in the story. \n",
      "‘But all that is only life’s setting, the real thing is love- \n",
      "love! Am I not right, Monsieur  Pierre?’ said he, growing \n",
      "animated. ‘Another glass?’ \n",
      "Pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a \n",
      "third. \n",
      "‘Oh, women, women!’ and the captain, looking with \n",
      "glistening eyes at Pierre, bega n talking of love and of his \n",
      "love affairs. \n",
      "There were very many of these, as one could easily \n",
      "believe, looking at the officer’s handsome, self-satisfied \n",
      "face, and noting the eager enthusiasm with which he \n",
      "spoke of women. Though all Ra mballe’s love stories had \n",
      "the sensual character which Frenchmen regard as the \n",
      "special charm and poetry of l ove, yet he told his story \n",
      "with such sincere convict ion that he alone had \n",
      "experienced and known all the charm of love and he \n",
      "described women so alluringly th at Pierre listened to him \n",
      "with curiosity. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2147 of 2882 \n",
      "It was plain that l’amour which the Frenchman was so \n",
      "fond of was not that low and simple kind that Pierre had \n",
      "once felt for his wife, nor was it the romantic love \n",
      "stimulated by himself that he  experienced for Natasha. \n",
      "(Ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally: the \n",
      "one he considered the ‘love of clodhoppers’ and the other \n",
      "the ‘love of simpletons.’) L’amour which the Frenchman \n",
      "worshiped consisted principally in the unnaturalness of \n",
      "his relation to the woman and in a combination of \n",
      "incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling. \n",
      "Thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his \n",
      "love for a fascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the \n",
      "same time for a charming, innocent child of seventeen, \n",
      "daughter of the bewitching marquise. The conflict of \n",
      "magnanimity between the mother and the daughter, \n",
      "ending in the mother’s sacrificing herself and offering her \n",
      "daughter in marriage to her lover, even now agitated the \n",
      "captain, though it was the memory  of a distant past. Then \n",
      "he recounted an episode in which the husband played the \n",
      "part of the lover, and he- th e lover- assumed the role of \n",
      "the husband, as well as seve ral droll incidents from his \n",
      "recollections of Germany, where ‘shelter’ is called \n",
      "Unterkunft and where the husbands eat sauerkraut and the \n",
      "young girls are ‘too blonde.’ War and Peace  \n",
      "2148 of 2882 \n",
      "Finally, the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the \n",
      "captain’s memory, and whic h he narrated with rapid \n",
      "gestures and glowing face, was of how he had saved the \n",
      "life of a Pole (in general, the saving of life continually \n",
      "occurred in the captain’s stories) and the Pole had \n",
      "entrusted to him his enchanting wife (parisienne de coeur) \n",
      "while himself entering the Fr ench service. The captain \n",
      "was happy, the enchanting Po lish lady wished to elope \n",
      "with him, but, prompted by magnanimity, the captain \n",
      "restored the wife to the hus band, saying as he did so: ‘I \n",
      "have saved your life, and I save your honor!’ Having \n",
      "repeated these words the capta in wiped his eyes and gave \n",
      "himself a shake, as if driv ing away the weakness which \n",
      "assailed him at this touching recollection. \n",
      "Listening to the captain’s tales, Pierre- as often \n",
      "happens late in the evening and under the influence of \n",
      "wine- followed all that was told him, understood it all, \n",
      "and at the same time followed a train of personal \n",
      "memories which, he knew not why, suddenly arose in his \n",
      "mind. While listening to these love stories his own love \n",
      "for Natasha unexpectedly rose to his mind, and going over \n",
      "the pictures of that love in  his imagination he mentally \n",
      "compared them with Ramballe’s tales. Listening to the \n",
      "story of the struggle between  love and duty, Pierre saw \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2149 of 2882 \n",
      "before his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting \n",
      "with the object of his love at the Sukharev water tower. At \n",
      "the time of that meeting it had not produced an effect \n",
      "upon him- he had not even once recalled it. But now it \n",
      "seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something \n",
      "very important and poetic. \n",
      "‘Peter Kirilovich, come here! We have recognized \n",
      "you,’ he now seemed to hear the words she had uttered \n",
      "and to see before him her eyes, her smile, her traveling \n",
      "hood, and a stray lock of her ha ir... and there seemed to \n",
      "him something pathetic and touching in all this. \n",
      "Having finished his tale about the enchanting Polish \n",
      "lady, the captain asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a \n",
      "similar impulse to sacrifice himself for love and a feeling \n",
      "of envy of the legitimate husband. \n",
      "Challenged by this question Pi erre raised his head and \n",
      "felt a need to express the thoughts that filled his mind. He \n",
      "began to explain that he understood love for a women \n",
      "somewhat differently. He said that in all hi s life he had \n",
      "loved and still loved only one woman, and that she could \n",
      "never be his. \n",
      "‘Tiens!’ said the captain. \n",
      "Pierre then explained that  he had loved this woman \n",
      "from his earliest years, but that he had not dared to think War and Peace  \n",
      "2150 of 2882 \n",
      "of her because she was too young, and because he had \n",
      "been an illegitimate son without a name. Afterwards when \n",
      "he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of \n",
      "her because he loved her t oo well, placing her far above \n",
      "everything in the world, and especially therefore above \n",
      "himself. \n",
      "When he had reached this point, Pierre asked the \n",
      "captain whether he understood that. \n",
      "The captain made a gesture si gnifying that even if he \n",
      "did not understand it he begged Pierre to continue. \n",
      "‘Platonic love, clouds...’ he muttered. \n",
      "Whether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse \n",
      "of frankness, or the thought that this man did not, and \n",
      "never would, know any of those who played a part in his \n",
      "story, or whether it was a ll these things together, \n",
      "something loosened Pierre’s tongue. Speaking thickly and \n",
      "with a faraway look in his shining eyes, he told the whole \n",
      "story of his life: his marriage, Natasha’s love for his best \n",
      "friend, her betrayal of him, and all his own simple \n",
      "relations with her. Urged on by Ramballe’s questions he \n",
      "also told what he had at fi rst concealed- his own position \n",
      "and even his name. \n",
      "More than anything else in  Pierre’s story the captain \n",
      "was impressed by the fact that  Pierre was very rich, had \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2151 of 2882 \n",
      "two mansions in Moscow, and that he had abandoned \n",
      "everything and not left the city, but remained there \n",
      "concealing his name and station. \n",
      "When it was late at night they went out together into \n",
      "the street. The night was warm and light. To the left of the \n",
      "house on the Pokrovka a fire glowed- th e first of those \n",
      "that were beginning in Mosc ow. To the right and high up \n",
      "in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and opposite \n",
      "to it hung that bright comet which was connected in \n",
      "Pierre’s heart with his love . At the gate stood Gerasim, \n",
      "the cook, and two Frenchmen. Their laughter and their \n",
      "mutually incomprehensible  remarks in two languages \n",
      "could be heard. They were looking at the glow seen in the \n",
      "town. \n",
      "There was nothing terrible in the one small, distant fire \n",
      "in the immense city. \n",
      "Gazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, at the \n",
      "comet, and at the glow from the fire, Pierre experienced a \n",
      "joyful emotion. ‘There now, how good it is, what more \n",
      "does one need?’ thought he. And suddenly remembering \n",
      "his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned \n",
      "against the fence to save himself from falling. \n",

      "2152 of 2882 \n",
      "Without taking leave of his new friend, Pierre left the \n",

      "The glow of the first fire that began on the second of \n",
      "September was watched from the various roads by the \n",

      "many different feelings. \n",
      "The Rostov party spent the night at Mytishchi, fourteen \n",
      "miles from Moscow. They had started so late on the first \n",
      "of September, the road had been so blocked by vehicles \n",
      "and troops, so many things ha d been forgotten for which \n",

      "came out into the porches. \n",
      "In a neighboring hut lay R aevski’s adjutant with a \n",

      "moan incessantly and piteously, and his moaning sounded War and Peace  \n",
      "2154 of 2882 \n",
      "terrible in the darkness of th e autumn night. He had spent \n",
      "the first night in the same  yard as the Rostovs. The \n",

      "2158 of 2882 \n",
      "the morning, when Sonya, to the surprise and annoyance \n",
      "of the countess, had for some unaccountable reason found \n",
      "it necessary to tell Natasha of Prince Andrew’s wound \n",

      "her, she turned her face to the window, looked out in such \n",
      "a way that it was evident that she could not see anything, \n",
      "and again settled down in her former attitude. \n",
      "‘But you didn’t see it!’ \n",
      "‘Yes, really I did,’ Natasha replied in a voice that \n",
      "pleaded to be left in peace. \n",
      "Both the countess and Sonya understood that, \n",
      "naturally, neither Moscow nor the burning of Moscow nor \n",

      "The count returned and lay down behind the partition. \n",
      "The countess went up to her daughter and touched her \n",

      "when Natasha was ill, then touched her forehead with her \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2159 of 2882 \n",

      "she could not see him, that he was seriously wounded but \n",

      "or to speak at all, evidently disbelieving what they told \n",
      "her, and convinced that say what she might she would still \n",
      "be told the same. All the way she had sat motionless in a \n",
      "corner of the coach with wide open eyes, and the \n",
      "expression in them which the countess knew so well and \n",
      "feared so much, and now she sat in the same way on the \n",
      "bench where she had seated herself on arriving. She was \n",
      "planning something and either  deciding or had already \n",
      "decided something in her mind. The countess knew this, \n",
      "but what it might be she did not know, and this alarmed \n",

      "‘Natasha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed.’ \n",
      "A bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess \n",

      "‘No, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor,’ \n",
      "Natasha replied irritably and she went to the window and \n",
      "opened it. Through the open window the moans of the \n",
      "adjutant could be heard more distinctly. She put her head \n",
      "out into the damp night air, and the countess saw her slim \n",
      "neck shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window \n",
      "frame. Natasha knew it was not Prince Andrew who was \n",
      "moaning. She knew Prince Andrew was in the same yard \n",
      "as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage; \n",
      "but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob. The \n",
      "countess exchanged a look with Sonya. \n",
      "‘Lie down, darling; lie down, my pet,’ said the \n",
      "countess, softly touching Natasha’s shoulders. ‘Come, lie \n",
      "down.’ \n",
      "‘Oh, yes... I’ll lie down at once,’ said Natasha, and \n",
      "began hurriedly undressing, tugging at the tapes of her \n",
      "petticoat. \n",
      "When she had thrown off her dress and put on a \n",
      "dressing jacket, she sat down with her foot under her on \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2161 of 2882 \n",
      "thin and rather short plait of  hair to the front, and began \n",
      "replaiting it. Her long, thi n, practiced fingers rapidly \n",
      "unplaited, replaited, and tied up her plait. Her head moved \n",
      "from side to side from hab it, but her eyes, feverishly \n",
      "wide, looked fixedly before her. When her toilet for the \n",
      "night was finished she sank ge ntly onto the sheet spread \n",
      "over the hay on the side nearest the door. \n",
      "‘Natasha, you’d better lie in the middle,’ said Sonya. \n",
      "‘I’ll stay here,’ muttered Natasha. ‘Do lie down,’ she \n",
      "added crossly, and buried her face in the pillow. \n",
      "The countess, Madame Schoss, and Sonya undressed \n",
      "hastily and lay down. The small lamp in front of the icons \n",
      "was the only light left in the room. But in the yard there \n",
      "was a light from the fire at Little Mytishchi a mile and a \n",
      "half away, and through the night came the noise of people \n",
      "shouting at a tavern Mam onov’s Cossacks had set up \n",
      "across the street, and the ad jutant’s unceasing moans \n",
      "could still be heard. \n",
      "For a long time Natasha list ened attentively to the \n",
      "sounds that reached her from inside and outside the room \n",
      "and did not move. First she he ard her mother praying and \n",
      "sighing and the creaking of her bed under her, then \n",
      "Madame Schoss’ familiar whistling snore and Sonya’s War and Peace  \n",
      "2162 of 2882 \n",
      "gentle breathing. Then the countess called to Natasha. \n",
      "Natasha did not answer. \n",
      "‘I think she’s asleep, Mamma,’ said Sonya softly. \n",
      "After short silence the count ess spoke again but this \n",

      "Soon after that Natasha heard her mother’s even \n",
      "breathing. Natasha did not m ove, though her little bare \n",
      "foot, thrust out from under th e quilt, was growing cold on \n",
      "the bare floor. \n",
      "As if to celebrate a vi ctory over everybody, a cricket \n",
      "chirped in a crack in the wall. A cock crowed far off and \n",
      "another replied near by. The shouting in the tavern had \n",
      "died down; only the moaning of the adjutant was heard. \n",
      "Natasha sat up. \n",
      "‘Sonya, are you asleep? Mamma?’ she whispered. \n",
      "No one replied. Natasha rose slowly and carefully, \n",
      "crossed herself, and steppe d cautiously on the cold and \n",
      "dirty floor with her slim, suppl e, bare feet. The boards of \n",
      "the floor creaked. Stepping cau tiously from one foot to \n",
      "the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and \n",
      "grasped the cold door handle. \n",
      "It seemed to her that so mething heavy was beating \n",
      "rhythmically against all the walls of the room: it was her \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2163 of 2882 \n",
      "own heart, sinking with alar m and terror and overflowing \n",
      "with love. \n",
      "She opened the door and stepped across the threshold \n",
      "and onto the cold, damp earthen floor of the passage. The \n",
      "cold she felt refreshed her. With her bare feet she touched \n",
      "a sleeping man, stepped over him, and opened the door \n",
      "into the part of the hut wher e Prince Andrew lay. It was \n",
      "dark in there. In the farthe st corner, on a bench beside a \n",
      "bed on which something was lying, stood a tallow candle \n",
      "with a long, thick, and smoldering wick. \n",
      "From the moment she had been told that of Prince \n",
      "Andrew’s wound and his presence there, Natasha had \n",
      "resolved to see him. She did not know why she had to, she \n",
      "knew the meeting would be painful, but felt the more \n",
      "convinced that it was necessary. \n",
      "All day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that \n",
      "night. But now that the moment had come she was filled \n",
      "with dread of what she might  see. How was he maimed? \n",
      "What was left of him? Was he like that incessant moaning \n",
      "of the adjutant’s? Yes, he was altogether like that. In her \n",
      "imagination he was that terrible moaning personified. \n",
      "When she saw an indistinct shape in the corner, and \n",
      "mistook his knees raised under the quilt for his shoulders, \n",
      "she imagined a horrible body there, and stood still in \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2164 of 2882 \n",
      "terror. But an irresistible impulse drew her forward. She \n",
      "cautiously took one step and then another, and found \n",
      "herself in the middle of a sm all room containing baggage. \n",
      "Another man- Timokhin- was lying in a corner on the \n",
      "benches beneath the icons, a nd two others- the doctor and \n",
      "a valet- lay on the floor. \n",
      "The valet sat up and whispered something. Timokhin, \n",
      "kept awake by the pain in his wounded leg, gazed with \n",
      "wide-open eyes at this strange  apparition of a girl in a \n",
      "white chemise, dressing jacket, and nightcap. The valet’s \n",
      "sleepy, frightened exclamation, ‘What do you want? \n",
      "What’s the matter?’ made Natasha approach more swiftly \n",
      "to what was lying in the corner. Horribly unlike a man as \n",
      "that body looked, she must see him. She passed the valet, \n",
      "the snuff fell from the candle wick, and she saw Prince \n",
      "Andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt, and such \n",
      "as she had always seen him. \n",
      "He was the same as ever, but  the feverish color of his \n",
      "face, his glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her, and \n",
      "especially his neck, delicate as a child’s, revealed by the \n",
      "turn-down collar of his shir t, gave him a peculiarly \n",
      "innocent, childlike look, such as she had never seen on \n",
      "him before. She went up to him and with a swift, flexible, \n",
      "youthful movement dropped on her knees. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2165 of 2882 \n",

      "Seven days had passed since Prince Andrew found \n",
      "himself in the ambulance station on the field of Borodino. \n",
      "His feverish state and the inflammation of his bowels, \n",
      "which were injured, were in the doctor’s opinion sure to \n",
      "carry him off. But on the seventh day he ate with pleasure \n",
      "a piece of bread with some tea, and the doctor noticed that \n",
      "his temperature was lower. He had regained \n",
      "consciousness that morning. The first night after they left \n",
      "Moscow had been fairly warm and he had remained in the \n",
      "caleche, but at Mytishchi the wounded man himself asked \n",
      "to be taken out and given some  tea. The pain caused by \n",
      "his removal into the hut had made him groan aloud and \n",
      "again lose consciousness. When he had been placed on his \n",
      "camp bed he lay for a long tim e motionless with closed \n",
      "eyes. Then he opened them and whispered softly: ‘And \n",
      "the tea?’ His remembering such a small detail of everyday \n",
      "life astonished the doctor. He  felt Prince Andrew’s pulse, \n",
      "and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had \n",
      "improved. He was dissatisfied because he knew by \n",
      "experience that if his patient did not die now, he would do \n",
      "so a little later with greater suffering. Timokhin, the red-\n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2167 of 2882 \n",
      "nosed major of Prince Andrew’s regiment, had joined him \n",
      "in Moscow and was being take n along with him, having \n",
      "been wounded in the leg at the battle of Borodino. They \n",
      "were accompanied by a doctor, Prince Andrew’s valet, his \n",
      "coach. man, and two orderlies. \n",
      "They gave Prince Andrew some tea. He drank it \n",
      "eagerly, looking with feverish eyes at the door in front of \n",
      "him as if trying to understand and remember something. \n",
      "‘I don’t want any more. Is Timokhin here?’ he asked. \n",
      "Timokhin crept along the bench to him. \n",
      "‘I am here, your excellency.’ \n",
      "‘How’s your wound?’ \n",
      "‘Mine, sir? All right. But how about you?’ \n",
      "Prince Andrew again pondered as if trying to \n",
      "remember something. \n",
      "‘Couldn’t one get a book?’ he asked. \n",
      "‘What book?’ \n",
      "‘The Gospels. I haven’t one.’ \n",
      "The doctor promised to procure it for him and began to \n",
      "ask how he was feeling. Prince Andrew answered all his \n",
      "questions reluctantly but re asonably, and then said he \n",
      "wanted a bolster placed under him as he was \n",
      "uncomfortable and in great pain. The doctor and valet \n",
      "lifted the cloak with which he was covered and, making War and Peace  \n",
      "2168 of 2882 \n",
      "wry faces at the noisome sme ll of mortifying flesh that \n",
      "came from the wound, began examining that dreadful \n",
      "place. The doctor was very much displeased about \n",
      "something and made a change in the dressings, turning the \n",
      "wounded man over so that he  groaned again and grew \n",
      "unconscious and delirious from the agony. He kept asking \n",
      "them to get him the book and put it under him. \n",
      "‘What trouble would it be to you?’ he said. ‘I have not \n",
      "got one. Please get it for me and put it under for a \n",
      "moment,’ he pleaded in a piteous voice. \n",
      "The doctor went into the passage to wash his hands. \n",
      "‘You fellows have no conscience,’ said he to the valet \n",
      "who was pouring water over his hands. ‘For just one \n",

      "growing confused from pain while being carried into the \n",
      "hut he again regained cons ciousness, and while drinking \n",
      "tea once more recalled all that  had happened to him, and \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2169 of 2882 \n",
      "above all vividly remembered the moment at the \n",
      "ambulance station when, at the si ght of the sufferings of a \n",
      "man he disliked, those new thoughts had come to him \n",
      "which promised him happiness. And those thoughts, \n",
      "though now vague and indefi nite, again possessed his \n",
      "soul. He remembered that he had now a new source of \n",
      "happiness and that this happiness had something to do \n",
      "with the Gospels. That was why he asked for a copy of \n",
      "them. The uncomfortable position in which they had put \n",
      "him and turned him over again confused his thoughts, and \n",
      "when he came to himself a third time it was in the \n",
      "complete stillness of the night. Everybody near him was \n",
      "sleeping. A cricket chirped from across the passage; \n",
      "someone was shouting and singing in the street; \n",
      "cockroaches rustled on the table, on the icons, and on the \n",
      "walls, and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and \n",
      "around the candle beside him,  the wick of which was \n",
      "charred and had shaped itself like a mushroom. \n",
      "His mind was not in a normal state. A healthy man \n",
      "usually thinks of, feels, and remembers innumerable \n",
      "things simultaneously, but has the power and will to select \n",
      "one sequence of thoughts or events on which to fix his \n",
      "whole attention. A healthy man can tear himself away \n",
      "from the deepest reflections  to say a civil word to War and Peace  \n",
      "2170 of 2882 \n",
      "someone who comes in and can then return again to his \n",
      "own thoughts. But Prince Andrew’s mind was not in a \n",
      "normal state in that respect. All the powers of his mind \n",
      "were more active and clearer than ever, but they acted \n",
      "apart from his will. Most diverse thoughts and images \n",
      "occupied him simultaneously. At times his brain suddenly \n",
      "began to work with a vigor, clearness, and depth it had \n",
      "never reached when he was in health, but suddenly in the \n",
      "midst of its work it would turn to some unexpected idea \n",
      "and he had not the strength to turn it back again. \n",
      "‘Yes, a new happiness was revealed to me of which \n",
      "man cannot be deprived,’ he thought as he lay in the semi-\n",
      "darkness of the quiet hut, gazi ng fixedly before him with \n",
      "feverish wide open eyes. ‘A happiness lying beyond \n",
      "material forces, outside the mate rial influences that act on \n",
      "man- a happiness of the soul alone, the happiness of \n",
      "loving. Every man can understand it, but to conceive it \n",
      "and enjoin it was possible only for God. But how did God \n",
      "enjoin that law? And why was the Son...?’ \n",
      "And suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke \n",
      "off, and Prince Andrew heard (without knowing whether \n",
      "it was a delusion or reality) a soft whispering voice \n",
      "incessantly and rhythmically repeating ‘piti-piti-piti,’ and \n",

      "more. At the same time he felt that above his face, above \n",
      "the very middle of it, some strange airy structure was \n",
      "being erected out of slender n eedles or splinters, to the \n",
      "sound of this whispered music. He felt that he had to \n",
      "balance carefully (though it was di fficult) so that this airy \n",
      "structure should not collapse;  but nevertheless it kept \n",
      "collapsing and again slowly  rising to the sound of \n",
      "whispered rhythmic music- ‘it stretches, stretches, \n",
      "spreading out and stretching,’ said Prince Andrew to \n",
      "himself. While listening to this whispering and feeling the \n",
      "sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this \n",
      "edifice of needles, he also  saw by glimpses a red halo \n",
      "round the candle, and heard the rustle of the cockroaches \n",
      "and the buzzing of the fly that flopped against his pillow \n",
      "and his face. Each time the fl y touched his face it gave \n",
      "him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not \n",
      "destroy the structure, though it knocked against the very \n",
      "region of his face where it was rising. But besides this \n",
      "there was something else of importance. It was something \n",
      "white by the door- the statue  of a sphinx, which also \n",
      "oppressed him. \n",
      "‘But perhaps that’s my shirt on the table,’ he thought, \n",
      "‘and that’s my legs, and that is the door, but why is it \n",

      "And suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the \n",
      "surface of his mind with peculiar clearness and force. \n",
      "‘Yes- love,’ he thought again quite clearly. ‘But not \n",
      "love which loves for something, for some quality, for \n",
      "some purpose, or for some reason, but the love which I- \n",
      "while dying- first experienced when I saw my enemy and \n",
      "yet loved him. I experienced that feeling of love which is \n",
      "the very essence of the s oul and does not require an \n",
      "object. Now again I feel that bliss. To love one’s \n",
      "neighbors, to love one’s enemies, to love everything, to \n",
      "love God in all His manifestat ions. It is possible to love \n",
      "someone dear to you with human love, but an enemy can \n",

      "‘When loving with human love one may pass from \n",

      "that same living Natasha whom of all people he most \n",

      "surprised but quietly happy. Natasha, motionless on her \n",
      "knees (she was unable to stir), with frightened eyes \n",

      "On the third of September Pierre awoke late. His head \n",
      "was aching, the clothes in which he had slept without \n",
      "undressing felt uncomfortable on his body, and his mind \n",
      "had a dim consciousness of something shameful he had \n",
      "done the day before. That something shameful was his \n",
      "yesterday’s conversation with Captain Ramballe. \n",
      "It was eleven by the clock, but it seemed peculiarly \n",
      "dark out of doors. Pierre rose , rubbed his eyes, and seeing \n",
      "the pistol with an engrav ed stock which Gerasim had \n",
      "replaced on the writing table, he remembered where he \n",
      "was and what lay before him that very day. \n",
      "‘Am I not too late?’ he thought. ‘No, probably he \n",
      "won’t make his entry into Moscow before noon.’ \n",
      "Pierre did not allow himsel f to reflect on what lay \n",
      "before him, but hastened to act. \n",
      "After arranging his clothes, he took the pistol and was \n",
      "about to go out. But it then occurred to him for the first \n",
      "time that he certainly could not carry the weapon in his \n",
      "hand through the streets. It was difficult to hide such a big \n",
      "pistol even under his wide coat. He could not carry it \n",
      "unnoticed in his belt or under his arm. Besides, it had War and Peace  \n",
      "2178 of 2882 \n",
      "been discharged, and he had not had time to reload it. ‘No \n",
      "matter, dagger will do,’ he said to himself, though when \n",
      "planning his design he had more than once come to the \n",
      "conclusion that the chief mist ake made by the student in \n",
      "1809 had been to try to kill Napoleon with a dagger. But \n",
      "as his chief aim consisted not  in carrying ou t his design, \n",
      "but in proving to himself th at he would not abandon his \n",
      "intention and was doing  all he could to achieve it, Pierre \n",
      "hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a green sheath \n",
      "which he had bought at the Sukharev market with the \n",
      "pistol, and hid it under his waistcoat. \n",
      "Having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap \n",
      "low on his head, Pierre went down the corridor, trying to \n",
      "avoid making a noise or meeting the captain, and passed \n",
      "out into the street. \n",
      "The conflagration, at which he had looked with so \n",
      "much indifference the even ing before, had greatly \n",
      "increased during the night. Moscow was on fire in several \n",
      "places. The buildings in Carriage Row, across the river, in \n",
      "the Bazaar and the Povarskoy, as well as the barges on the \n",
      "Moskva River and the timber  yards by the Dorogomilov \n",
      "Bridge, were all ablaze. \n",
      "Pierre’s way led through side  streets to the Povarskoy \n",
      "and from there to the church of St. Nicholas on the Arbat, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2179 of 2882 \n",
      "where he had long before de cided that the deed should \n",
      "should be done. The gates of  most of the houses were \n",
      "locked and the shutters up. The streets and lanes were \n",
      "deserted. The air was full of smoke and the smell of \n",
      "burning. Now and then he met Russians with anxious and \n",
      "timid faces, and Frenchmen with an air not of the city but \n",
      "of the camp, walking in the middle of the streets. Both the \n",
      "Russians and the French looked at Pierre with surprise. \n",
      "Besides his height and stoutne ss, and the strange morose \n",
      "look of suffering in his face and whole figure, the \n",
      "Russians stared at Pierre because they could not make out \n",
      "to what class he could belong. The French followed him \n",
      "with astonishment in their eyes chiefly because Pierre, \n",
      "unlike all the other Russians who gazed at the French with \n",
      "fear and curiosity, paid no atte ntion to them. At the gate \n",
      "of one house three Frenchmen, who were explaining \n",
      "something to some Russians who did not understand \n",
      "them, stopped Pierre asking if he did not know French. \n",
      "Pierre shook his head and went on. In another side \n",
      "street a sentinel standing beside a green caisson shouted at \n",
      "him, but only when the shout was threateningly repeated \n",
      "and he heard the click of the man’s musket as he raised it \n",
      "did Pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side \n",
      "of the street. He heard nothing and saw nothing of what War and Peace  \n",
      "2180 of 2882 \n",
      "went on around him. He carri ed his resolution within \n",
      "himself in terror and haste, like something dreadful and \n",
      "alien to him, for, after the pr evious night’s experience, he \n",
      "was afraid of losing it. But he was not destined to bring \n",
      "his mood safely to his destination. And even had he not \n",
      "been hindered by anything on the way, his intention could \n",
      "not now have been carried out, for Napoleon had passed \n",
      "the Arbat more than four hours previously on his way \n",
      "from the Dorogomilov suburb to the Kremlin, and was \n",
      "now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal \n",
      "study in the Kremlin, giving deta iled and exact orders as \n",
      "to measures to be taken immediately to extinguish the \n",
      "fire, to prevent looting, and to reassure the inhabitants. \n",
      "But Pierre did not know this; he  was entirely absorbed in \n",
      "what lay before him, and wa s tortured- as those are who \n",
      "obstinately undertake a task th at is impossible for them \n",
      "not because of its difficulty but because of its \n",
      "incompatibility with their natures- by the fear of \n",
      "weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his self-\n",
      "esteem. \n",
      "Though he heard and saw nothing around him he found \n",
      "his way by instinct and did not go wrong in the side \n",
      "streets that led to the Povarskoy. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2181 of 2882 \n",
      "As Pierre approached that street the smoke became \n",
      "denser and denser- he even felt the heat of the fire. \n",
      "Occasionally curly tongues of  flame rose from under the \n",
      "roofs of the houses. He met more people in the streets and \n",
      "they were more excited. Bu t Pierre, though he felt that \n",
      "something unusual was happening around him, did not \n",
      "realize that he was approach ing the fire. As he was going \n",
      "along a foot path across a wide-open space adjoining the \n",
      "Povarskoy on one side and the gardens of Prince \n",
      "Gruzinski’s house on the other, Pierre suddenly heard the \n",
      "desperate weeping of a woma n close to him. He stopped \n",
      "as if awakening from a dream and lifted his head. \n",
      "By the side of the path, on the dusty dry grass, all sorts \n",
      "of household goods lay in a heap : featherbeds, a samovar, \n",
      "icons, and trunks. On the ground, beside the trunks, sat a \n",
      "thin woman no longer young, with long, prominent upper \n",
      "teeth, and wearing a black cloak and cap. This woman, \n",
      "swaying to and fro and muttering something, was choking \n",
      "with sobs. Two girls of about ten and twelve, dressed in \n",
      "dirty short frocks and cloaks, were staring at their mother \n",
      "with a look of stupefaction on their pale frightened faces. \n",
      "The youngest child, a boy of about seven, who wore an \n",
      "overcoat and an immense cap evidently not his own, was \n",
      "crying in his old nurse’s arms . A dirty, barefooted maid War and Peace  \n",
      "2182 of 2882 \n",
      "was sitting on a trunk, and, having undone her pale-\n",
      "colored plait, was pulling it straight and sniffing at her \n",
      "singed hair. The woman’s husband, a short, round-\n",
      "shouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian \n",
      "official, with sausage-shaped whiskers and showing under \n",
      "his square-set cap the hair smoothly brushed forward over \n",
      "his temples, with expressionless face was moving the \n",
      "trunks, which were placed one on another, and was \n",
      "dragging some garments from under them. \n",
      "As soon as she saw Pierre, the woman almost threw \n",
      "herself at his feet. \n",
      "‘Dear people, good Christians, save me, help me, dear \n",
      "friends... help us, somebody,’ she muttered between her \n",
      "sobs. ‘My girl... My daughte r! My youngest daughter is \n",
      "left behind. She’s burned! O oh! Was it for this I nursed \n",
      "you.... Ooh!’ \n",
      "‘Don’t, Mary Nikolievna!’ said her husband to her in a \n",
      "low voice, evidently only to justify himself before the \n",
      "stranger. ‘Sister must have taken her, or else where can \n",
      "she be?’ he added. \n",
      "‘Monster! Villain!’ shouted the woman angrily, \n",
      "suddenly ceasing to weep. ‘You have no heart, you don’t \n",
      "feel for your own child! Another man would have rescued \n",
      "her from the fire. But this is a monster and neither a man \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2183 of 2882 \n",
      "nor a father! You, honored sir, are a noble man,’ she went \n",
      "on, addressing Pierre rapidly be tween her sobs. ‘The fire \n",
      "broke out alongside, and blew our way, the maid called \n",
      "out ‘Fire!’ and we rushed to collect our things. We ran out \n",
      "just as we were.... This is what we have brought away.... \n",
      "The icons, and my dowry bed, all the rest is lost. We \n",
      "seized the children. But not Katie! Ooh! O Lord!...’ and \n",
      "again she began to sob. ‘My child, my dear one! Burned, \n",
      "burned!’ \n",
      "‘But where was she left?’ asked Pierre. \n",
      "From the expression of his animated face the woman \n",
      "saw that this man might help her. \n",
      "‘Oh, dear sir!’ she cried, seizing him by the legs. ‘My \n",
      "benefactor, set my heart at ease.... Aniska, go, you horrid \n",
      "girl, show him the way!’ she cried to the maid, angrily \n",

      "teeth. \n",
      "‘Show me the way, show me, I... I’ll do it,’ gasped \n",
      "Pierre rapidly. \n",
      "The dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk, \n",
      "put up her plait, sighed, and went  on her short, bare feet \n",
      "along the path. Pierre felt as if he had come back to life \n",
      "after a heavy swoon. He held his head higher, his eyes \n",
      "shone with the light of life,  and with swift steps he War and Peace  \n",
      "2184 of 2882 \n",
      "followed the maid, overtook her, and came out on the \n",
      "Povarskoy. The whole street wa s full of clouds of black \n",
      "smoke. Tongues of flame here and there broke through \n",
      "that cloud. A great number of people crowded in front of \n",
      "the conflagration. In the mi ddle of the street stood a \n",

      "into a yard on the right. \n",

      "the large house that was as yet burning only at one end, \n",
      "just below the roof, and around which swarmed a crowd \n",

      "he had no time to dwell on that idea. \n",

      "and ceilings, the whistle and hiss of the flames, the \n",
      "excited shouts of the people, and the sight of the swaying \n",
      "smoke, now gathering into thick black clouds and now \n",
      "soaring up with glittering sp arks, with here and there \n",
      "dense sheaves of flame (now red and now like golden fish War and Peace  \n",
      "2186 of 2882 \n",
      "scales creeping along the walls), and the heat and smoke \n",
      "and rapidity of motion, produced on Pierre the usual \n",
      "animating effects of a confla gration. It had a peculiarly \n",
      "strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt \n",
      "himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed \n",
      "him down. He felt young, bright, adroit, and resolute. He \n",
      "ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to \n",
      "dash into that part of it which was still standing, when just \n",
      "above his head he heard seve ral voices shouting and then \n",
      "a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling \n",
      "close beside him. \n",
      "Pierre looked up and saw at  a window of the large \n",
      "house some Frenchmen who had just thrown out the \n",
      "drawer of a chest, filled with  metal articles. Other French \n",
      "soldiers standing below went up to the drawer. \n",
      "‘What does this fellow want?’ shouted one of them \n",
      "referring to Pierre. \n",
      "‘There’s a child in that  house. Haven’t you seen a \n",
      "child?’ cried Pierre. \n",
      "‘What’s he talking about? Get along!’ said several \n",
      "voices, and one of the soldiers, evidently afraid that Pierre \n",
      "might want to take from th em some of the plate and \n",
      "bronzes that were in the drawer, moved threateningly \n",
      "toward him. \n",

      "2187 of 2882 \n",
      "‘A child?’ shouted a Frenchman from above. ‘I did \n",

      "human, you know...’ \n",
      "‘Where is it? Where?’ said Pierre. \n",
      "‘There! There!’ shouted the Frenchman at the window, \n",
      "pointing to the garden at th e back of the house. ‘Wait a \n",
      "bit- I’m coming down.’ \n",
      "And a minute or two later the Frenchman, a black-eyed \n",
      "fellow with a spot on his cheek, in shirt sleeves, really did \n",
      "jump out of a window on the ground floor, and clapping \n",
      "Pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the garden. \n",
      "‘Hurry up, you others!’ he called out to his comrades. \n",
      "‘It’s getting hot.’ \n",
      "When they reached a gravel path behind the house the \n",
      "Frenchman pulled Pierre by the arm and pointed to a \n",
      "round, graveled space where a three-year-old girl in a \n",
      "pink dress was lying under a seat. \n",
      "‘There is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the better!’ \n",
      "said the Frenchman. ‘Good-by, Fatty. We must be human, \n",
      "we are all mortal you know!’ and the Frenchman with the \n",

      "Breathless with joy, Pierre ran to the little girl and was \n",

      "2188 of 2882 \n",
      "sickly, scrofulous-looking child, unattractively like her \n",

      "seized her and lifted her in his arms. She screamed \n",
      "desperately and angrily and trie d with her little hands to \n",
      "pull Pierre’s hands away a nd to bite them with her \n",

      "and repulsion such as he had experienced when touching \n",
      "some nasty little animal. But he made an effort not to \n",
      "throw the child down and ran with her to the large house. \n",
      "It was now, however, impossible to get back the way he \n",
      "had come; the maid, Aniska, was no longer there, and \n",
      "Pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the wet, \n",

      "Chapter XXXIV \n",
      "Having run through different yards and side streets, \n",
      "Pierre got back with his lit tle burden to the Gruzinski \n",

      "recognize the place from which he had set out to look for \n",
      "the child, so crowded was it  now with people and goods \n",
      "that had been dragged out of the houses. Besides Russian \n",
      "families who had taken refuge here from the fire with \n",
      "their belongings, there were se veral French soldiers in a \n",

      "hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to \n",
      "restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone \n",
      "else. Pierre felt that he ha d still much to do and to do \n",
      "quickly. Glowing with the h eat and from running, he felt \n",
      "at that moment more strongl y than ever the sense of \n",
      "youth, animation, and determination that had come on \n",
      "him when he ran to save the child. She had now become \n",
      "quiet and, clinging w ith her little hands to Pierre’s coat, \n",
      "sat on his arm gazing about her like some little wild \n",

      "2190 of 2882 \n",
      "He did not find the civil serv ant or his wife where he \n",
      "had left them. He walked among the crowd with rapid \n",
      "steps, scanning the various f aces he met. Involuntarily he \n",
      "noticed a Georgian or Armeni an family consisting of a \n",
      "very handsome old man of Orie ntal type, wearing a new, \n",
      "cloth-covered, sheepskin co at and new boots, an old \n",
      "woman of similar type, and a young woman. That very \n",
      "young woman seemed to Pierre the perfection of Oriental \n",
      "beauty, with her sharply outlined, arched, black eyebrows \n",
      "and the extraordinarily soft , bright color of her long, \n",
      "beautiful, expressionless f ace. Amid the scattered \n",
      "property and the crowd on the open space, she, in her rich \n",
      "satin cloak with a bright lilac shawl on her head, \n",
      "suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the \n",
      "snow. She was sitting on some bundles a little behind the \n",
      "old woman, and looked from under her long lashes with \n",
      "motionless, large, almond-shaped eyes at the ground \n",
      "before her. Evidently she was aware of her beauty and \n",
      "fearful because of it. Her f ace struck Pierre and, hurrying \n",

      "When he had reached the fence, still without finding those \n",
      "he sought, he stopped and looked about him. \n",

      "2191 of 2882 \n",
      "With the child in his arms his figure was now more \n",

      "and at two French soldiers who had gone up to them. One \n",
      "of these, a nimble little man, was wearing a blue coat tied \n",
      "round the waist with a rope . He had a nightcap on his \n",
      "head and his feet were bare. The other, whose appearance \n",
      "particularly struck Pi erre, was a long, lank, round-\n",
      "shouldered, fair-haired man, slow in his movements and \n",
      "with an idiotic expression of face. He wore a woman’s \n",
      "loose gown of frieze, blue trousers, and large torn Hessian \n",
      "boots. The little barefooted Frenchman in the blue coat \n",
      "went up to the Armenians and, saying something, \n",
      "immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old \n",

      "The old man was already sitting barefoot. The little \n",
      "Frenchman had secured his second boot and was slapping \n",
      "one boot against the other. The old man was saying \n",
      "something in a voice broken by sobs, but Pierre caught \n",
      "but a glimpse of this, his whol e attention was directed to \n",
      "the Frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile, \n",
      "swaying slowly from side to side, had drawn nearer to the \n",

      "*\"Look here, no nonsense!’ \n",
      "Pierre was in such a transport of rage that he \n",

      "He rushed at the barefooted  Frenchman and, before the \n",
      "latter had time to draw his sword, knocked him off his \n",
      "feet and hammered him with hi s fists. Shouts of approval \n",
      "were heard from the crowd around, and at the same \n",
      "moment a mounted patrol of  French Uhlans appeared \n",
      "from round the corner. The Uh lans came up at a trot to \n",
      "Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them. Pierre \n",

      "2195 of 2882 \n",
      "right, you can tell all about it at  the court-martial.’ Then \n",
      "he turned to Pierre. ‘Do you speak French?’ \n",
      "Pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did \n",
      "not reply. His face probably looked very terrible, for the \n",

      "A little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from \n",

      "little girl, and when the patrol started she moved forward. \n",
      "‘Where are they taking you to, you poor dear?’ said \n",

      "her if she’s not theirs?’ said the woman. \n",
      "‘What does that woman want?’ asked the officer. \n",
      "Pierre was as if intoxicated. His elation increased at the \n",
      "sight of the little girl he had saved. \n",
      "‘What does she want?’ he murmured. ‘She is bringing \n",

      "2258 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter IX \n",
      "The officer and soldiers who had arrested Pierre \n",
      "treated him with hostility but yet with respect, in the \n",
      "guardhouse to which he was taken. In their attitude \n",
      "toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as to who \n",
      "he might be- perhaps a very important person- and \n",
      "hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict with \n",

      "felt that for the new guard- both officers and men- he was \n",
      "not as interesting as he had been to his captors; and in fact \n",
      "the guard of the second day did not recognize in this big, \n",
      "stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person who had \n",
      "fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy \n",
      "and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child; \n",
      "they saw in him only No. 17 of the captured Russians, \n",
      "arrested and detained for some reason by order of the \n",
      "Higher Command. If they noticed anything remarkable \n",
      "about Pierre, it was only his unabashed, meditative \n",
      "concentration and thoughtfulness, and the way he spoke \n",
      "French, which struck them as  surprisingly good. In spite \n",
      "of this he was placed that day with the other arrested \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2259 of 2882 \n",
      "suspects, as the separate room he had occupied was \n",
      "required by an officer. \n",
      "All the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the \n",
      "lowest class and, recognizing him as a gentleman, they all \n",
      "avoided him, more especially as he spoke French. Pierre \n",
      "felt sad at hearing them making fun of him. \n",
      "That evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, \n",
      "probably, among them) were to be tried for incendiarism. \n",
      "On the third day he was taken with the others to a house \n",
      "where a French general with a white mustache sat with \n",
      "two colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves on their \n",
      "arms. With the precision a nd definiteness customary in \n",
      "addressing prisoners, and which is supposed to preclude \n",
      "human frailty, Pierre like the others was questioned as to \n",
      "who he was, where he had been, with what object, and so \n",
      "on. \n",
      "These questions, like questions  put at trials generally, \n",
      "left the essence of the matter aside, shut out the possibility \n",
      "of that essence’s being reve aled, and were designed only \n",
      "to form a channel through which the judges wished the \n",
      "answers of the accused to flow so  as to lead to the desired \n",
      "result, namely a conviction. As  soon as Pierre began to \n",
      "say anything that did not fit in with that aim, the channel \n",
      "was removed and the water coul d flow to waste. Pierre \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2260 of 2882 \n",
      "felt, moreover, what the accused always feel at their trial, \n",
      "perplexity as to why these questions were put to him. He \n",
      "had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or a \n",
      "kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was \n",
      "employed. He knew he was in these men’s power, that \n",
      "only by force had they brought him there, that force alone \n",
      "gave them the right to dema nd answers to their questions, \n",
      "and that the sole object of th at assembly was to inculpate \n",
      "him. And so, as they had the power and wish to inculpate \n",
      "him, this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed \n",
      "unnecessary. It was evident that any answer would lead to \n",
      "conviction. When asked what he was doing when he was \n",
      "arrested, Pierre replied in a rather tragic manner that he \n",
      "was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the \n",
      "flames. Why had he fought the marauder? Pierre \n",
      "answered that he ‘was prot ecting a woman,’ and that ‘to \n",
      "protect a woman who was being insulted was the duty of \n",
      "every man; that...’ They interrupted him, for this was not \n",
      "to the point. Why was he in the yard of a burning house \n",
      "where witnesses had seen him? He replied that he had \n",
      "gone out to see what was happening in Moscow. Again \n",
      "they interrupted him: they had not asked where he was \n",
      "going, but why he was found near the fire? Who was he? \n",
      "they asked, repeating their first question, which he had \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2261 of 2882 \n",
      "declined to answer. Again he  replied that he could not \n",
      "answer it. \n",
      "‘Put that down, that’s bad... very bad,’ sternly \n",
      "remarked the general with the white mustache and red \n",
      "flushed face. \n",
      "On the fourth day fires broke out on the Zubovski \n",
      "rampart. \n",
      "Pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach \n",
      "house of a merchant’s house near the Crimean bridge. On \n",
      "his way through the streets Pierre felt stifled by the smoke \n",
      "which seemed to hang over the whole city. Fires were \n",
      "visible on all sides. He did not then realize the \n",
      "significance of the burning of Moscow, and looked at the \n",
      "fires with horror. \n",
      "He passed four days in the coach house near the \n",
      "Crimean bridge and during that time learned, from the \n",
      "talk of the French soldiers, that all those confined there \n",
      "were awaiting a decision which might come any day from \n",
      "the marshal. What marshal this was, Pierre could not learn \n",
      "from the soldiers. Evidently for them ‘the marshal’ \n",
      "represented a very high and rather mysterious power. \n",
      "These first days, before the eighth of September when \n",
      "the prisoners were had up for a second examination, were \n",
      "the hardest of all for Pierre. War and Peace  \n",
      "2262 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter X \n",
      "On the eighth of September an officer- a very \n",
      "important one judging by the respect the guards showed \n",
      "him- entered the coach house where the prisoners were. \n",
      "This officer, probably someone on the staff, was holding a \n",
      "paper in his hand, and called over all the Russians there, \n",
      "naming Pierre as ‘the man who does not give his name.’ \n",
      "Glancing indolently and indiffere ntly at all the prisoners, \n",
      "he ordered the officer in charge to have them decently \n",
      "dressed and tidied up before taking them to the marshal. \n",
      "An hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and Pierre with \n",
      "thirteen others was led to the Virgin’s Field. It was a fine \n",
      "day, sunny after rain, and the air was unusually pure. The \n",
      "smoke did not hang low as on the day when Pierre had \n",
      "been taken from the guardhouse on the Zubovski rampart, \n",
      "but rose through the pure air in  columns. No flames were \n",
      "seen, but columns of smoke rose on all sides, and all \n",
      "Moscow as far as Pierre c ould see was one vast charred \n",
      "ruin. On all sides there we re waste spaces with only \n",
      "stoves and chimney stacks st ill standing, and here and \n",
      "there the blackened walls of some brick houses. Pierre \n",
      "gazed at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2263 of 2882 \n",
      "known well. Here and there he  could see churches that \n",
      "had not been burned. The Kremlin, which was not \n",
      "destroyed, gleamed white in the distance with its towers \n",
      "and the belfry of Ivan the Great. The domes of the New \n",
      "Convent of the Virgin glittered  brightly and its bells were \n",
      "ringing particularly clearly. These bells reminded Pierre \n",
      "that it was Sunday and the feast of the Nativity of the \n",
      "Virgin. But there seemed to be no one to celebrate this \n",
      "holiday: everywhere were blackened ruins, and the few \n",
      "Russians to be seen were ta ttered and frightened people \n",
      "who tried to hide when they saw the French. \n",
      "It was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and \n",
      "destroyed, but in place of the Russian order of life that \n",
      "had been destroyed, Pierre un consciously felt that a quite \n",
      "different, firm, French order had been established over \n",
      "this ruined nest. He felt this in the l ooks of the soldiers \n",
      "who, marching in regular ranks  briskly and gaily, were \n",
      "escorting him and the other cr iminals; he felt it in the \n",
      "looks of an important French official in a carriage and \n",
      "pair driven by a soldier, whom they met on the way. He \n",
      "felt it in the merry sounds of regimental music he heard \n",
      "from the left side of the field, and felt and realized it \n",
      "especially from the list of prisoners the French officer had \n",
      "read out when he came that morning. Pierre had been War and Peace  \n",
      "2264 of 2882 \n",
      "taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to \n",
      "another place with dozens of other men, and it seemed \n",
      "that they might have forgotten him, or confused him with \n",
      "the others. But no: the answers he had given when \n",
      "questioned had come back to him in his designation as \n",
      "‘the man who does not give his name,’ and under that \n",
      "appellation, which to Pierre seemed terrible, they were \n",
      "now leading him somewhere w ith unhesitating assurance \n",
      "on their faces that he and al l the other prisoners were \n",
      "exactly the ones they wanted and that they were being \n",
      "taken to the proper place. Pier re felt himself to be an \n",
      "insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine \n",
      "whose action he did not understand but which was \n",
      "working well. \n",
      "He and the other prisoners were taken to the right side \n",
      "of the Virgin’s Field, to a large white house with an \n",
      "immense garden not far from the convent. This was \n",
      "Prince Shcherbitov’s house, where Pierre had often been \n",
      "in other days, and which, as he learned from the talk of \n",
      "the soldiers, was now occupied  by the marshal, the Duke \n",
      "of Eckmuhl (Davout). \n",
      "They were taken to the en trance and led into the house \n",
      "one by one. Pierre was the sixth to enter. He was \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2265 of 2882 \n",
      "hall, which were familiar to him, into a long low study at \n",
      "the door of which stood an adjutant. \n",
      "Davout, spectacles on nose, sa t bent over a table at the \n",
      "further end of the room. Pierre  went close up to him, but \n",
      "Davout, evidently consulting a paper that lay before him, \n",
      "did not look up. Without raising his eyes, he said in a low \n",
      "voice: \n",
      "‘Who are you?’ \n",
      "Pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering \n",
      "a word. To him Davout was not merely a French general, \n",
      "but a man notorious for his cruelty. Looking at his cold \n",
      "face, as he sat like a stern schoolmaster who was prepared \n",
      "to wait awhile for an answer, Pierre felt that every instant \n",
      "of delay might cost him his life; but he did not know what \n",
      "to say. He did not venture to repeat what he had said at his \n",
      "first examination, yet to disclose his rank and position \n",
      "was dangerous and embarrassing. So he was silent. But \n",
      "before he had decided what to  do, Davout raised his head, \n",
      "pushed his spectacles back on his forehead, screwed up \n",
      "his eyes, and looked intently at him. \n",
      "‘I know that man,’ he said in a cold, measured tone, \n",
      "evidently calculated to frighten Pierre. \n",
      "The chill that had been r unning down Pierre’s back \n",
      "now seized his head as in a vise. War and Peace  \n",
      "2266 of 2882 \n",
      "‘You cannot know me, Genera l, I have never seen \n",
      "you..’ \n",
      "‘He is a Russian spy,’ Da vout interrupted, addressing \n",
      "another general who was present, but whom Pierre had \n",
      "not noticed. \n",
      "Davout turned away. With an unexpected reverberation \n",
      "in his voice Pierre rapidly began: \n",
      "‘No, monseigneur,’ he said, suddenly remembering \n",
      "that Davout was a duke. ‘No, monseigneur, you cannot \n",
      "have known me. I am a militia officer and have not \n",
      "quitted Moscow.’ \n",
      "‘Your name?’ asked Davout. \n",
      "‘Bezukhov.’ \n",
      "‘What proof have I that you are not lying?’ \n",
      "‘Monseigneur!’ exclaimed Pierre, not in an offended \n",
      "but in a pleading voice. \n",
      "Davout looked up and gazed intently at him. For some \n",
      "seconds they looked at one a nother, and that look saved \n",
      "Pierre. Apart from conditions of war and law, that look \n",
      "established human relations between the two men. At that \n",
      "moment an immense number  of things passed dimly \n",
      "through both their minds, and they realized that they were \n",
      "both children of humanity and were brothers. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2267 of 2882 \n",
      "At the first glance, when Davout had only raised his \n",
      "head from the papers where human affairs and lives were \n",
      "indicated by numbers, Pierre was merely a circumstance, \n",
      "and Davout could have shot  him without burdening his \n",
      "conscience with an evil deed, but now he saw in him a \n",
      "human being. He reflected for a moment. \n",
      "‘How can you show me that you are telling the truth?’ \n",
      "said Davout coldly. \n",
      "Pierre remembered Ramba lle, and named him and his \n",
      "regiment and the street where the house was. \n",
      "‘You are not what you say,’ returned Davout. \n",
      "In a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began adducing \n",
      "proofs of the truth of his statements. \n",
      "But at that moment an adjutant entered and reported \n",
      "something to Davout. \n",
      "Davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought, \n",
      "and began buttoning up his uniform. It seemed that he had \n",
      "quite forgotten Pierre. \n",
      "When the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner, he \n",
      "jerked his head in Pierre’s  direction with a frown and \n",
      "ordered him to be led away. But where they were to take \n",
      "him Pierre did not know: back to the coach house or to the \n",
      "place of execution his companions had pointed out to him \n",
      "as they crossed the Virgin’s Field. War and Peace  \n",
      "2268 of 2882 \n",
      "He turned his head and saw that the adjutant was \n",
      "putting another question to Davout. \n",
      "‘Yes, of course!’ replied Davout, but what this ‘yes’ \n",
      "meant, Pierre did not know. \n",
      "Pierre could not afterwards remember how he went, \n",
      "whether it was far, or in which direction. His faculties \n",
      "were quite numbed, he was stupefied, and noticing \n",
      "nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others \n",
      "did till they all stopped and he stopped too. The only \n",
      "thought in his mind at that time was: who was it that had \n",
      "really sentenced him to death? Not the men on the \n",
      "commission that had first exam ined him- not one of them \n",
      "wished to or, evidently, c ould have done it. It was not \n",
      "Davout, who had looked at him in so human a way. In \n",
      "another moment Davout would ha ve realized that he was \n",
      "doing wrong, but just then the adjutant had come in and \n",
      "interrupted him. The adjutant , also, had evidently had no \n",
      "evil intent though he might ha ve refrained from coming \n",
      "in. Then who was executing hi m, killing him, depriving \n",
      "him of life- him, Pierre, with all his memories, \n",
      "aspirations, hopes, and thoughts? Who was doing this? \n",
      "And Pierre felt that it was no one. \n",
      "It was a system- a concurrence of circumstances. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2269 of 2882 \n",
      "A system of some sort was killing him- Pierre- \n",

      "been set up. Beyond that post a fresh pit had been dug in \n",
      "the ground, and near the post and the pit a large crowd \n",
      "stood in a semicircle. The crowd consisted of a few \n",
      "Russians and many of Napoleon’ s soldiers who were not \n",
      "on duty- Germans, Italians, and Frenchmen, in a variety \n",

      "understanding. He could only hear and see. And he had \n",
      "only one wish- that the fright ful thing that had to happen \n",
      "should happen quickly. Pierre  looked round at his fellow \n",
      "prisoners and scrutinized them. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2271 of 2882 \n",
      "The two first were convicts with shaven heads. One \n",
      "was tall and thin, the other dark, shaggy, and sinewy, with \n",
      "a flat nose. The third was a domestic serf, about forty-five \n",
      "years old, with grizzled ha ir and a plump, well-nourished \n",
      "body. The fourth was a peasant, a very handsome man \n",
      "with a broad, light-brown bear d and black eyes. The fifth \n",
      "was a factory hand, a thin, sallo w-faced lad of eighteen in \n",

      "Pierre heard the French c onsulting whether to shoot \n",
      "them separately or two at a time. ‘In couples,’ replied the \n",
      "officer in command in a calm  voice. There was a stir in \n",
      "the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident that they were \n",
      "all hurrying- not as men hurry to do something they \n",
      "understand, but as people hurry to finish a necessary but \n",
      "unpleasant and incomprehensible task. \n",
      "A French official wearing a scarf came up to the right \n",

      "reached the post and, while sacks were being brought, \n",
      "looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an \n",

      "2272 of 2882 \n",
      "the other scratched his back and made a movement of the \n",
      "lips resembling a smile. With hurried hands the soldiers \n",
      "blindfolded them, drawing the sacks over their heads, and \n",
      "bound them to the post. \n",
      "Twelve sharpshooters with mu skets stepped out of the \n",
      "ranks with a firm regular tr ead and halted eight paces \n",
      "from the post. Pierre turned  away to avoid seeing what \n",
      "was going to happen. Suddenly a crackling, rolling noise \n",
      "was heard which seemed to him louder than the most \n",
      "terrific thunder, and he looked round. There was some \n",
      "smoke, and the Frenchmen were doing something near the \n",
      "pit, with pale faces and trembling hands. Two more \n",
      "prisoners were led up. In the same way and with similar \n",

      "a silent appeal for protection in their eyes, evidently \n",
      "unable to understand or believe what was going to happen \n",

      "Again Pierre did not wish to look and again turned \n",
      "away; but again the sound as of a frightful explosion \n",
      "struck his ear, and at the same moment he saw smoke, \n",
      "blood, and the pale, scared faces of the Frenchmen who \n",
      "were again doing something by the post, their trembling \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2273 of 2882 \n",
      "hands impeding one another. Pierre, breathing heavily, \n",
      "looked around as if asking what it meant. The same \n",
      "question was expressed in all the looks that met his. \n",
      "On the faces of all the Russians and of the French \n",
      "soldiers and officers without exception, he read the same \n",

      "‘But who, after all, is doing this? They are all suffering as \n",
      "I am. Who then is it? Who?’ flashed for an instant through \n",
      "his mind. \n",
      "‘Sharpshooters of the 86th, forward!’ shouted \n",
      "someone. The fifth prisoner, the one next to Pierre, was \n",
      "led away- alone. Pierre did no t understand that he was \n",
      "saved, that he and the rest had been brought there only to \n",
      "witness the execution. With ever-growing horror, and no \n",
      "sense of joy or relief, he gazed at what was taking place. \n",
      "The fifth man was the factory lad in the loose cloak. The \n",
      "moment they laid hands on him he sprang aside in terror \n",
      "and clutched at Pierre. (Pierre shuddered and shook \n",
      "himself free.) The lad was una ble to walk. They dragged \n",
      "him along, holding him up under the arms, and he \n",
      "screamed. When they got him to the post he grew quiet, \n",
      "as if he suddenly underst ood something. Whether he \n",
      "understood that screaming was useless or whether he \n",
      "thought it incredible that men should kill him, at any rate War and Peace  \n",
      "2274 of 2882 \n",
      "he took his stand at the post,  waiting to be blindfolded \n",
      "like the others, and like a wounded animal looked around \n",
      "him with glittering eyes. \n",
      "Pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his \n",
      "eyes. His curiosity and agitation, like that of the whole \n",
      "crowd, reached the highest pitch at this fifth murder. Like \n",
      "the others this fifth man seemed calm; he wrapped his \n",
      "loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the \n",
      "other. \n",
      "When they began to blindfol d him he himself adjusted \n",
      "the knot which hurt the back of  his head; then when they \n",
      "propped him against the bloodstained post, he leaned back \n",
      "and, not being comfortable in  that position, straightened \n",
      "himself, adjusted his feet, and leaned back again more \n",
      "comfortably. Pierre did not take his eyes from him and \n",
      "did not miss his slightest movement. \n",
      "Probably a word of command was given and was \n",
      "followed by the reports of eight  muskets; but try as he \n",
      "would Pierre could not afterwards remember having heard \n",
      "the slightest sound of the shots. He only saw how the \n",
      "workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him, \n",
      "how blood showed itself in  two places, how the ropes \n",
      "slackened under the weight of the hanging body, and how \n",
      "the workman sat down, his head hanging unnaturally and \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2275 of 2882 \n",
      "one leg bent under him. Pierre ran up to the post. No one \n",
      "hindered him. Pale, fright ened people were doing \n",
      "something around the workman. The lower jaw of an old \n",
      "Frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he untied \n",
      "the ropes. The body collapsed. The soldiers dragged it \n",
      "awkwardly from the post and began pushing it into the \n",

      "They all plainly and certainly knew that they were \n",
      "criminals who must hide the traces of their guilt as \n",
      "quickly as possible. \n",
      "Pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad \n",
      "was lying with his knees cl ose up to his head and one \n",
      "shoulder higher than the other. That shoulder rose and fell \n",
      "rhythmically and convulsivel y, but spadefuls of earth \n",
      "were already being thrown over the whole body. One of \n",
      "the soldiers, evidently suffering, shouted gruffly and \n",
      "angrily at Pierre to go back. But Pierre did not understand \n",
      "him and remained near the post, and no one drove him \n",
      "away. \n",
      "When the pit had been filled up a command was given. \n",
      "Pierre was taken back to his place, and the rows of troops \n",
      "on both sides of the post made a half turn and went past it \n",
      "at a measured pace. The twenty-four sharpshooters with War and Peace  \n",
      "2276 of 2882 \n",
      "discharged muskets, standing in the center of the circle, \n",
      "ran back to their places as the companies passed by. \n",

      "sharpshooters who ran in couples out of the circle. All but \n",
      "one rejoined their companie s. This one, a young soldier, \n",
      "his face deadly pale, his shako pushed back, and his \n",
      "musket resting on the ground, still stood near the pit at the \n",
      "spot from which he had fi red. He swayed like a drunken \n",
      "man, taking some steps forward and back to save himself \n",
      "from falling. An old, noncommissioned officer ran out of \n",
      "the ranks and taking him by th e elbow dragged him to his \n",
      "company. The crowd of Russians and Frenchmen began \n",

      "‘You’ve seen a lot of trouble,  sir, eh?’ the little man \n",
      "suddenly said. \n",
      "And there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his \n",
      "singsong voice that Pierre tr ied to reply, but his jaw \n",
      "trembled and he felt tears ri sing to his eyes. The little \n",
      "fellow, giving Pierre no time to betray his confusion, \n",
      "instantly continued in the same pleasant tones: \n",
      "‘Eh, lad, don’t fret!’ said he, in the tender singsong \n",
      "caressing voice old Russian peasant women employ. \n",
      "‘Don’t fret, friend- ‘suffer an hour, live for an age!’ that’s \n",
      "how it is, my dear fellow. And here we live, thank \n",
      "heaven, without offense. Among these folk, too, there are \n",

      "good men as well as bad,’ said he, and still speaking, he \n",
      "turned on his knees with a supple movement, got up, \n",
      "coughed, and went off to another part of the shed. \n",
      "‘Eh, you rascal!’ Pierre he ard the same kind voice \n",
      "saying at the other end of th e shed. ‘So you’ve come, you \n",
      "rascal? She remembers... Now, now, that’ll do!’ \n",
      "And the soldier, pushing away a little dog that was \n",
      "jumping up at him, returned to his place and sat down. In \n",
      "his hands he had something wrapped in a rag. \n",
      "‘Here, eat a bit, sir,’ sa id he, resuming his former \n",
      "respectful tone as he unwra pped and offered Pierre some \n",
      "baked potatoes. ‘We had soup for dinner and the potatoes \n",
      "are grand!’ \n",
      "Pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the \n",
      "potatoes seemed extremely pl easant to him. He thanked \n",
      "the soldier and began to eat. \n",
      "‘Well, are they all right?’ said the soldier with a smile. \n",
      "‘You should do like this.’ \n",
      "He took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, cut the \n",
      "potato into two equal halves  on the palm of his hand, \n",
      "sprinkled some salt on it from the rag, and handed it to \n",
      "Pierre. \n",
      "‘The potatoes are grand!’ he said once more. ‘Eat some \n",
      "like that!’ War and Peace  \n",
      "2282 of 2882 \n",
      "Pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted \n",
      "better. \n",
      "‘Oh, I’m all right,’ said he , ‘but why did they shoot \n",
      "those poor fellows? The last one was hardly twenty.’ \n",
      "‘Tss, tt...!’ said the little man. ‘Ah, what a sin... what a \n",
      "sin!’ he added quickly, and as if his words were always \n",
      "waiting ready in his mouth and flew out involuntarily he \n",
      "went on: ‘How was it, sir, that you stayed in Moscow?’ \n",
      "‘I didn’t think they would come so soon. I stayed \n",
      "accidentally,’ replied Pierre. \n",
      "‘And how did they arrest you, dear lad? At your \n",
      "house?’ \n",
      "‘No, I went to look at the fi re, and they arrested me \n",
      "there, and tried me as an incendiary.’ \n",
      "‘Where there’s law there’s injustice,’ put in the little \n",
      "man. \n",
      "‘And have you been here long?’ Pierre asked as he \n",
      "munched the last of the potato. \n",
      "‘I? It was last Sunday they took me, out of a hospital in \n",
      "Moscow.’ \n",
      "‘Why, are you a soldier then?’ \n",
      "‘Yes, we are soldiers of the Apsheron regiment. I was \n",
      "dying of fever. We weren’t told anything. There were \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2283 of 2882 \n",
      "some twenty of us lying there. We had no idea, never \n",
      "guessed at all.’ \n",
      "‘And do you feel sad here?’ Pierre inquired. \n",
      "‘How can one help it, lad? My name is Platon, and the \n",
      "surname is Karataev,’ he added, evidently wishing to \n",
      "make it easier for Pierre to address him. ‘They call me \n",
      "‘little falcon’ in the regiment. How is one to help feeling \n",
      "sad? Moscow- she’s the mother of cities. How can one \n",
      "see all this and not feel sa d? But ‘the maggot gnaws the \n",
      "cabbage, yet dies first’; that’s what the old folks used to \n",
      "tell us,’ he added rapidly. \n",
      "‘What? What did you say?’ asked Pierre. \n",
      "‘Who? I?’ said Karataev. ‘I say things happen not as \n",
      "we plan but as God judges,’ he replied, thinking that he \n",
      "was repeating what he had said before, and immediately \n",
      "continued: \n",
      "‘Well, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a \n",
      "house? So you have abundance, then? And a housewife? \n",
      "And your old parents, are they still living?’ he asked. \n",
      "And though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt \n",
      "that a suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the \n",
      "soldier’s lips as he put these questions. He seemed \n",
      "grieved that Pierre had no pare nts, especially that he had \n",
      "no mother. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2284 of 2882 \n",
      "‘A wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but \n",
      "there’s none as dear as one’s own mother!’ said he. ‘Well, \n",
      "and have you little ones?’ he went on asking. \n",
      "Again Pierre’s negative answer seemed to distress him, \n",
      "and he hastened to add: \n",
      "‘Never mind! You’re young folks yet, and please God \n",
      "may still have some. The great thing is to live in \n",
      "harmony...’ \n",
      "‘But it’s all the same now ,’ Pierre could not help \n",
      "saying. \n",
      "‘Ah, my dear fellow!’ rejoined Karataev, ‘never \n",
      "decline a prison or a beggar’s sack!’ \n",
      "He seated himself more  comfortably and coughed, \n",
      "evidently preparing to tell a long story. \n",
      "‘Well, my dear fellow, I wa s still living at home,’ he \n",
      "began. ‘We had a well-to-do homestead, plenty of land, \n",
      "we peasants lived well and our house was one to thank \n",
      "God for. When Father and we went out mowing there \n",
      "were seven of us. We lived well. We were real peasants. It \n",
      "so happened..’ \n",
      "And Platon Karataev told a long story of how he had \n",
      "gone into someone’s copse to take wood, how he had \n",
      "been caught by the keeper, had been tried, flogged, and \n",
      "sent to serve as a soldier. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2285 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Well, lad,’ and a smile changed the tone of his voice \n",
      "‘we thought it was a misfort une but it turned out a \n",
      "blessing! If it had not been for my sin, my brother would \n",
      "have had to go as a soldier. But he, my younger brother, \n",
      "had five little ones, while I,  you see, only left a wife \n",
      "behind. We had a little girl, but God took her before I \n",
      "went as a soldier. I come home on leave and I’ll tell you \n",
      "how it was, I look and see that  they are living better than \n",
      "before. The yard full of cattl e, the women at home, two \n",
      "brothers away earning wages, and only Michael the \n",
      "youngest, at home. Father, he says, ‘All my children are \n",
      "the same to me: it hurts the same whichever finger gets \n",
      "bitten. But if Platon hadn’t b een shaved for a soldier, \n",
      "Michael would have had to go.’ called us all to him and, \n",
      "will you believe it, placed us in front of the icons. \n",
      "‘Michael,’ he says, ‘come here and bow down to his feet; \n",
      "and you, young woman, you bow down too; and you, \n",
      "grandchildren, also bow down before him! Do you \n",
      "understand?’ he says. That’s how it is, dear fellow. Fate \n",
      "looks for a head. But we are always judging, ‘that’s not \n",
      "well- that’s not right!’ Our luck is like water in a dragnet: \n",
      "you pull at it and it bulges, but when you’ve drawn it out \n",
      "it’s empty! That’s how it is.’ \n",
      "And Platon shifted his seat on the straw. War and Peace  \n",
      "2286 of 2882 \n",
      "After a short silence he rose. \n",
      "‘Well, I think you must be sleepy,’ said he, and began \n",
      "rapidly crossing himself and repeating: \n",
      "‘Lord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and \n",
      "Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ, hol y Saint Nicholas, Frola and \n",
      "Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ, ha ve mercy on us and save us!’ \n",
      "he concluded, then bowed to the ground, got up, sighed, \n",
      "and sat down again on his heap of straw. ‘That’s the way. \n",
      "Lay me down like a stone, O God, and raise me up like a \n",
      "loaf,’ he muttered as he lay down, pulling his coat over \n",
      "him. \n",
      "‘What prayer was that you were saying?’ asked Pierre. \n",
      "‘Eh?’ murmured Platon, who had almost fallen asleep. \n",
      "‘What was I saying? I was praying. Don’t you pray?’ \n",
      "‘Yes, I do,’ said Pierre. ‘But what was that you said: \n",
      "Frola and Lavra?’ \n",
      "‘Well, of course,’ replied Platon quickly, ‘the horses’ \n",
      "saints. One must pity the animals too. Eh, the rascal! Now \n",
      "you’ve curled up and got warm, you daughter of a bitch!’ \n",
      "said Karataev, touching the dog that lay at his feet, and \n",
      "again turning over he fell asleep immediately. \n",
      "Sounds of crying and screaming came from \n",
      "somewhere in the distance outside, and flames were \n",
      "visible through the cracks of the shed, but inside it was \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2287 of 2882 \n",
      "quiet and dark. For a long tim e Pierre did not sleep, but \n",
      "lay with eyes open in the darkness, listening to the regular \n",
      "snoring of Platon who lay beside  him, and he felt that the \n",
      "world that had been shattered was once more stirring in \n",
      "his soul with a new beauty and on new and unshakable \n",
      "foundations. War and Peace  \n",
      "2288 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XIII \n",
      "Twenty-three soldiers, three officers, and two officials \n",
      "were confined in the shed in which Pierre had been placed \n",
      "and where he remained for four weeks. \n",
      "When Pierre remembered them afterwards they all \n",
      "seemed misty figures to him except Platon Karataev, who \n",
      "always remained in his mind a most vivid and precious \n",
      "memory and the personification of everything Russian, \n",
      "kindly, and round. When Pierre saw his neighbor next \n",
      "morning at dawn the first impression of him, as of \n",
      "something round, was fully confirmed: Platon’s whole \n",
      "figure- in a French overco at girdled with a cord, a \n",
      "soldier’s cap, and bast shoe s- was round. His head was \n",
      "quite round, his back, chest, shoulders, and even his arms, \n",
      "which he held as if ever ready to embrace something, \n",
      "were rounded, his pleasant smile and his large, gentle \n",
      "brown eyes were also round. \n",
      "Platon Karataev must have  been fifty, judging by his \n",
      "stories of campaigns he had been in, told as by an old \n",
      "soldier. He did not himsel f know his age and was quite \n",
      "unable to determine it. But hi s brilliantly white, strong \n",
      "teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2289 of 2882 \n",
      "laughed- as he often did- were all sound and good, there \n",
      "was not a gray hair in his beard or on his head, and his \n",
      "whole body gave an impression of suppleness and \n",
      "especially of firmness and endurance. \n",
      "His face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an \n",
      "expression of innocence and youth, his voice was pleasant \n",
      "and musical. But the chief peculiarity of his speech was \n",
      "its directness and appositeness. It was evident that he \n",
      "never considered what he ha d said or was going to say, \n",
      "and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation \n",
      "had an irresistible persuasiveness. \n",
      "His physical strength and agility during the first days \n",
      "of his imprisonment were such  that he seemed not to \n",
      "know what fatigue and sickness meant. Every night \n",
      "before lying down, he said: ‘Lord, lay me down as a stone \n",
      "and raise me up as a loaf!’ and every morning on getting \n",
      "up, he said: ‘I lay down and curled up, I get up and shake \n",
      "myself.’ And indeed he onl y had to lie down, to fall \n",
      "asleep like a stone, and he onl y had to shake himself, to \n",
      "be ready without a moment’s delay for some work, just as \n",
      "children are ready to play directly they awake. He could \n",
      "do everything, not very well but not badly. He baked, \n",
      "cooked, sewed, planed, and mended boots. He was always \n",
      "busy, and only at night allowe d himself conversation- of War and Peace  \n",
      "2290 of 2882 \n",
      "which he was fond- and songs. He did not sing like a \n",
      "trained singer who knows he is  listened to, but like the \n",
      "birds, evidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way \n",
      "that one stretches oneself or  walks about to get rid of \n",
      "stiffness, and the sounds were always high-pitched, \n",
      "mournful, delicate, and almost  feminine, and his face at \n",
      "such times was very serious. \n",
      "Having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to \n",
      "grow, he seemed to have thrown off all that had been \n",
      "forced upon him- everything military and alien to himself- \n",
      "and had returned to his former peasant habits. \n",
      "‘A soldier on leave- a shirt outside breeches,’ he would \n",
      "say. \n",
      "He did not like talking about his life as a soldier, \n",
      "though he did not complain, and often mentioned that he \n",
      "had not been flogged once during the whole of his army \n",
      "service. When he related anyt hing it was generally some \n",
      "old and evidently precious memo ry of his ‘Christian’ life, \n",
      "as he called his peasant existe nce. The proverbs, of which \n",
      "his talk was full, were for the most part not the coarse and \n",
      "indecent saws soldiers employ, but those folk sayings \n",
      "which taken without a context seem so insignificant, but \n",
      "when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance of \n",
      "profound wisdom. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2291 of 2882 \n",
      "He would often say the exact opposite of what he had \n",
      "said on a previous occasion, yet both would be right. He \n",
      "liked to talk and he talked well, adorning his speech with \n",
      "terms of endearment and with folk sayings which Pierre \n",
      "thought he invented himself, but the chief charm of his \n",
      "talk lay in the fact that th e commonest events- sometimes \n",
      "just such as Pierre had witn essed without taking notice of \n",
      "them- assumed in Karataev’s a character of solemn \n",
      "fitness. He liked to hear the folk tales one of the soldiers \n",
      "used to tell of an evening (t hey were always the same), \n",
      "but most of all he liked to hear stories of real life. He \n",
      "would smile joyfully when listening to such stories, now \n",
      "and then putting in a word or asking a question to make \n",
      "the moral beauty of what he was told clear to himself. \n",
      "Karataev had no attachments,  friendships, or love, as \n",
      "Pierre understood them, but loved and lived affectionately \n",
      "with everything life brought  him in contact with, \n",
      "particularly with man- not any particular man, but those \n",
      "with whom he happened to be. He loved his dog, his \n",
      "comrades, the French, and Pi erre who was his neighbor, \n",
      "but Pierre felt that in spite of Karataev’s affectionate \n",
      "tenderness for him (by whic h he unconsciously gave \n",
      "Pierre’s spiritual life its due) he would not have grieved War and Peace  \n",
      "2292 of 2882 \n",
      "for a moment at parting from  him. And Pierre began to \n",
      "feel in the same way toward Karataev. \n",
      "To all the other prisoners Platon Karataev seemed a \n",
      "most ordinary soldier. They called him ‘little falcon’ or \n",
      "‘Platosha,’ chaffed him good-naturedly, and sent him on \n",
      "errands. But to Pierre he always remained what he had \n",
      "seemed that first night: an unfathomable, rounded, eternal \n",
      "personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth. \n",
      "Platon Karataev knew nothing by heart except his \n",
      "prayers. When he began to speak he seemed not to know \n",
      "how he would conclude. \n",
      "Sometimes Pierre, struck by the meaning of his words, \n",
      "would ask him to repeat th em, but Platon could never \n",
      "recall what he had said a moment before, just as he never \n",
      "could repeat to Pierre the words of his favorite song: \n",
      "native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in it, \n",
      "but when spoken and not sung,  no meaning could be got \n",
      "out of it. He did not, and could not, understand the \n",
      "meaning of words apart from their context. Every word \n",
      "and action of his was the ma nifestation of an activity \n",
      "unknown to him, which was his life. But his life, as he \n",
      "regarded it, had no meaning as  a separate thing. It had \n",
      "meaning only as part of a whole of which he was always \n",
      "conscious. His words and acti ons flowed from him as \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2293 of 2882 \n",
      "evenly, inevitably, and spontaneously as fragrance \n",

      "already saw in imagination Andrew’s face as she \n",
      "remembered it in childhood, a gentle, mild, sympathetic \n",
      "face which he had rarely shown, and which therefore \n",

      "surprised at what she was saying. \n",
      "‘That, my dear, you must ask the doctor,’ he replied, \n",

      "and especially in that calm, almost antagonistic look \n",
      "could be felt an estrangeme nt from everything belonging \n",

      "stopped his carriage, and inquired what regiment they \n",
      "belonged to. They belonged to a column that should have \n",
      "been far in front and in ambush long before then. ‘It may \n",

      "‘How! Not rec...’ Kutuzov began, but checked himself \n",
      "immediately and sent for a se nior officer. Getting out of \n",
      "his caleche, he waited with  drooping head and breathing \n",
      "heavily, pacing silently up and down. When Eykhen, the \n",
      "officer of the general sta ff whom he had summoned, \n",
      "appeared, Kutuzov went purple in the face, not because \n",
      "that officer was to blame for the mistake, but because he \n",
      "was an object of sufficient im portance for him to vent his \n",
      "wrath on. Trembling and panting the old man fell into that \n",
      "state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on the \n",

      "‘What sort of another blackguard are you? I’ll have \n",
      "you shot! Scoundrels!’ yelled Ku tuzov in a hoarse voice, \n",

      "The ground was damp but not muddy, and the troops \n",
      "advanced noiselessly, only occasionally a jingling of the \n",

      "to talk out loud, to smoke their pipes, or to strike a light, \n",
      "and they tried to prevent their horses neighing. The \n",
      "secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm and they \n",

      "Toward dawn, Count Orlov-Denisov, who had dozed \n",

      "2347 of 2882 \n",
      "being brought to him. This was a Polish sergeant of \n",

      "come over because he had been slighted in the service: \n",
      "that he ought long ago to have been made an officer, that \n",
      "he was braver than any of them, and so he had left them \n",
      "and wished to pay them out. He said that Murat was \n",
      "spending the night less than a mile from where they were, \n",
      "and that if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred \n",
      "men he would capture him a live. Count Orlov-Denisov \n",
      "consulted his fellow officers. \n",
      "The offer was too tempting to be refused. Everyone \n",
      "volunteered to go and everybody advised making the \n",

      "General Grekov with two Cossack regiments decided to \n",
      "go with the Polish sergeant. \n",
      "‘Now, remember,’ said Count Orlov-Denisov to the \n",

      "Without replying, the sergeant,  with a resolute air, \n",

      "Count Orlov-Denisov, having se en Grekov off, returned, \n",
      "shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and War and Peace  \n",
      "2348 of 2882 \n",
      "excited by what he had undertaken on his own \n",
      "responsibility, and began looking at the enemy camp, now \n",
      "just visible in the deceptiv e light of dawn and the dying \n",
      "campfires. Our columns ought to have begun to appear on \n",

      "keen-sighted adjutant confirmed this. \n",
      "‘Oh, it is really too late,’ said Count Orlov, looking at \n",

      "As often happens when someone  we have trusted is no \n",
      "longer before our eyes, it suddenly seemed quite clear and \n",

      "All this had to be dealt with, the prisoners and guns \n",
      "secured, the booty divided- not without some shouting \n",

      "The French, not being farther pursued, began to \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2351 of 2882 \n",
      "confusion, and finally a back ward movement. Adjutants \n",

      "called it Azor; the soldier who told stories called it \n",
      "Femgalka; Karataev and ot hers called it Gray, or \n",

      "and mustache covered the lower part of his face, and a \n",
      "tangle of hair, infested with lice, curled round his head \n",

      "and examined the seams. \n",
      "‘You see, dear man, this is not a sewing shop, and I \n",

      "in heroic feats of self-sacrifice, and in romantic love for \n",
      "Natasha; he had sought it by reasoning- and all these \n",

      "things were no business of his, and that he was not called \n",
      "on to judge concerning them and therefore could not do \n",
      "so. ‘Russia and summer weather are not bound together,’ \n",

      "his calculations of the cabali stic number of the beast of \n",
      "the Apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even \n",
      "ridiculous. His anger with hi s wife and anxi ety that his \n",

      "2386 of 2882 \n",
      "understood Prince Andrew’s thoughts somewhat \n",

      "shade of bitterness and irony as though he was really \n",
      "saying that all desire for pos itive happiness is implanted \n",
      "in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied. But \n",
      "Pierre believed it without any mental reservation. The \n",

      "consequent freedom in the choice of one’s occupation, \n",
      "that is, of one’s way of life, now seemed to Pierre to be \n",

      "when he wanted to eat, drinking when he wanted to drink, \n",
      "sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of warmth when he \n",

      "mysterious, callous force whic h compelled people against \n",
      "their will to kill thei r fellow men- that force the effect of \n",
      "which he had witnessed during the executions. To fear or \n",
      "to try to escape that force, to address entreaties or \n",
      "exhortations to those who served as its tools, was useless. \n",

      "captain was also in marching kit, and on his cold face \n",
      "appeared that same it which Pierre had recognized in the \n",

      "‘Be so good...’ shouted the captain, frowning angrily. \n",
      "‘Dram-da-da-dam, dam-dam...’ rattled the drums, and \n",
      "Pierre understood that this mysterious force completely \n",
      "controlled these men and that  it was now useless to say \n",
      "any more. \n",
      "The officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers \n",

      "2393 of 2882 \n",
      "alien. Not far from him walked a fat major with a sallow, \n",
      "bloated, angry face, who was wearing a Kazan dressing \n",
      "grown tied round with a towel, and who evidently enjoyed \n",
      "the respect of his fellow prisoners. He kept one hand, in \n",
      "which he clasped his tobacco pouch, inside the bosom of \n",
      "his dressing gown and held th e stem of his pipe firmly \n",
      "with the other. Panting and puffing, the major grumbled \n",
      "and growled at everybody because he thought he was \n",
      "being pushed and that they we re all hurrying when they \n",
      "had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at \n",
      "something when there was nothing to be surprised at. \n",
      "Another, a thin little officer, was speaking to everyone, \n",

      "his identification of the different wards of Moscow. \n",
      "‘What are you disputing about?’ said the major angrily. \n",
      "‘What does it matter whether it is St. Nicholas or St. \n",
      "Blasius? You see it’s burned down, and there’s an end of War and Peace  \n",
      "2394 of 2882 \n",
      "it.... What are you pushing for? Isn’t the road wide \n",
      "enough?’ said he, turning to a man behind him who was \n",
      "not pushing him at all. \n",
      "‘Oh, oh, oh! What have they done?’ the prisoners on \n",
      "one side and another were he ard saying as they gazed on \n",

      "Yes, I told you- th e whole quarter be yond the river, and \n",
      "so it is.’ \n",
      "‘Well, you know it’s burned, so what’s the use of \n",

      "When they had crossed the Crimean bridge the \n",
      "prisoners moved a few steps forward, halted, and again \n",

      "heard the rattle of wheels, th e tramp of feet, and incessant \n",
      "shouts of anger and abuse. Pierre stood pressed against \n",
      "the wall of a charred house, listening to that noise which \n",
      "mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums. \n",
      "To get a better view, several officer prisoners climbed \n",

      "‘What crowds! Just look at the crowds!... They’ve \n",

      "of the others what so attracted their curiosity. In three \n",
      "carriages involved among the munition carts, closely \n",
      "squeezed together, sat women with rouged faces, dressed \n",

      "him strange or dreadful: neit her the corpse smeared with \n",

      "Pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw \n",

      "All these people and horses seemed driven forward by \n",
      "some invisible power. Duri ng the hour Pierre watched \n",
      "them they all came flowing from the different streets with \n",
      "one and the same desire to ge t on quickly; they all jostled \n",
      "one another, began to grow angry and to fight, white teeth \n",

      "when the drums were beating. \n",
      "It was not till nearly evening that the officer \n",
      "commanding the escort collected his men and with shouts War and Peace  \n",
      "2400 of 2882 \n",
      "and quarrels forced his way in  among the baggage trains, \n",
      "and the prisoners, hemmed in  on all sides, emerged onto \n",
      "the Kaluga road. \n",
      "They marched very quickly, without resting, and halted \n",
      "only when the sun began to set. The baggage carts drew \n",
      "up close together and the men began to prepare for their \n",
      "night’s rest. They all appeared angry and dissatisfied. For \n",
      "a long time, oaths, angry shouts, and fighting could be \n",
      "heard from all sides. A carriage that followed the escort \n",
      "ran into one of the carts and knocked a hole  in it with its \n",
      "pole. Several soldiers ran to ward the cart from different \n",
      "sides: some beat the carri age horses on their heads, \n",
      "turning them aside, others fought among themselves, and \n",
      "Pierre saw that one German was badly wounded on the \n",
      "head by a sword. \n",
      "It seemed that all these men, now that they had stopped \n",
      "amid fields in the chill dusk of the autumn evening, \n",
      "experienced one and the sa me feeling of unpleasant \n",
      "awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on that \n",
      "had seized them at the start. Once at a standstill they all \n",
      "seemed to understand that they did not yet know where \n",
      "they were going, and that much that was painful and \n",
      "difficult awaited them on this journey. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2401 of 2882 \n",
      "During this halt the escort treated the prisoners even \n",
      "worse than they had done at the start. It was here that the \n",
      "prisoners for the first time received horseflesh for their \n",
      "meat ration. \n",
      "From the officer down to the lowest soldier they \n",
      "showed what seemed like personal spite against each of \n",
      "the prisoners, in unexpected contrast to their former \n",
      "friendly relations. \n",
      "This spite increased still more when, on calling over \n",
      "the roll of prisone rs, it was found that  in the bustle of \n",
      "leaving Moscow one Russian soldier, who had pretended \n",
      "to suffer from colic, had escaped. Pierre saw a Frenchman \n",
      "beat a Russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from the \n",
      "road, and heard his friend the captain reprimand and \n",
      "threaten to court-martial a noncommissioned officer on \n",

      "noncommissioned officer’s excuse that the prisoner was \n",
      "ill and could not walk, the o fficer replied that the order \n",

      "fatal force which had crushed him during the executions, \n",
      "but which be had not felt dur ing his imprisonment, now \n",
      "again controlled his existence. It was terrible, but he felt \n",
      "that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush War and Peace  \n",
      "2402 of 2882 \n",
      "him, there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of \n",
      "life independent of it. \n",
      "He ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh \n",
      "and chatted with his comrades. \n",
      "Neither Pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they \n",
      "had seen in Moscow, or of the roughness of their \n",
      "treatment by the French, or of  the order to shoot them \n",
      "which had been announced to them. As if in reaction \n",
      "against the worsening of their position they were all \n",
      "particularly animated and gay. They spoke of personal \n",
      "reminiscences, of amusing scenes they had witnessed \n",
      "during the campaign, and avoided all talk of their present \n",
      "situation. \n",
      "The sun had set long since. Br ight stars shone out here \n",
      "and there in the sky. A red glow as of a conflagration \n",
      "spread above the horizon from the rising full moon, and \n",
      "that vast red ball swayed st rangely in the gray haze. It \n",
      "grew light. The evening was e nding, but the night had not \n",
      "yet come. Pierre got up and left his new companions, \n",
      "crossing between the campfire s to the other side of the \n",
      "road where he had been told the common soldier \n",

      "Pierre turned back, not to his companions by the \n",

      "nobody. Tucking his legs under him and dropping his \n",
      "head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the \n",
      "cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in \n",
      "thought. Suddenly he burst out into a fit of his broad, \n",
      "good-natured laughter, so l oud that men from various \n",
      "sides turned with surprise to  see what this strange and \n",
      "evidently solitary laughter could mean. \n",
      "‘Ha-ha-ha!’ laughed Pierre. And he said aloud to \n",
      "himself: ‘The soldier did not let me pass. They took me \n",
      "and shut me up. They hold me captive. What, me? Me? \n",
      "My immortal soul? Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!...’ and he \n",

      "2404 of 2882 \n",
      "farther still, beyond those fore sts and fields, the bright, \n",

      "The man who had wakened yawned and stretched \n",

      "rascal, where do you always hide it?’ said the voice of the \n",
      "man who was stretching himself, to the orderly. (This was \n",
      "Shcherbinin, Konovnitsyn’s adjutant.) ‘I’ve found it, I’ve \n",
      "found it!’ he added. \n",
      "The orderly was striking a light and Shcherbinin was \n",
      "fumbling for something on the candlestick. \n",
      "‘Oh, the nasty beasts!’ said he with disgust. \n",
      "By the light of the sparks Bolkhovitinov saw \n",
      "Shcherbinin’s youthful face as he held the candle, and the \n",
      "face of another man who wa s still asleep. This was \n",
      "Konovnitsyn. War and Peace  \n",
      "2412 of 2882 \n",
      "When the flame of the sul phur splinters kindled by the \n",
      "tinder burned up, first blue and then red, Shcherbinin lit \n",
      "the tallow candle, from the candlestick of which the \n",
      "cockroaches that had been gnawing it were running away, \n",
      "and looked at the messe nger. Bolkhovitinov was \n",
      "bespattered all over with m ud and had smeared his face \n",
      "by wiping it with his sleeve. \n",
      "‘Who gave the report?’ inquired Shcherbinin, taking \n",
      "the envelope. \n",
      "‘The news is reliable,’ said Bolkhovitinov. ‘Prisoners, \n",
      "Cossacks, and the scouts all say the same thing.’ \n",
      "‘There’s nothing to be done, we’ll have to wake him,’ \n",
      "said Shcherbinin, rising and going up to the man in the \n",
      "nightcap who lay covered by a greatcoat. ‘Peter \n",
      "Petrovich!’ said he. (Konovnits yn did not stir.) ‘To the \n",
      "General Staff!’ he said with  a smile, knowing that those \n",
      "words would be sure to arouse him. \n",
      "And in fact the head in th e nightcap was lifted at once. \n",

      "flushed by fever, there still remained for an instant a \n",
      "faraway dreamy expression remote from present affairs, \n",
      "but then he suddenly started and his face assumed its \n",
      "habitual calm and firm appearance. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2413 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Well, what is it? From whom?’ he asked immediately \n",
      "but without hurry, blinking at the light. \n",
      "While listening to the officer’s report Konovnitsyn \n",
      "broke the seal and read the dispatch. Hardly had he done \n",
      "so before he lowered his legs in their woolen stockings to \n",
      "the earthen floor and began put ting on his boots. Then he \n",
      "took off his nightcap, combed hi s hair over his temples, \n",
      "and donned his cap. \n",
      "‘Did you get here quickly? Let us go to his Highness.’ \n",
      "Konovnitsyn had understood at once that the news \n",
      "brought was of great importance and that no time must be \n",
      "lost. He did not consider or ask himself whether the news \n",
      "was good or bad. That did not interest him. He regarded \n",
      "the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or \n",
      "his reason but by something else. There was within him a \n",
      "deep unexpressed conviction th at all would be well, but \n",
      "that one must not trust to this and still less speak about it, \n",
      "but must only attend to one’s  own work. And he did his \n",
      "work, giving his whole strength to the task. \n",
      "Peter Petrovich Konovnitsyn, like Dokhturov, seems to \n",
      "have been included merely for propriety’s sake in the list \n",
      "of the so-called heroes of 1812- the Barclays, Raevskis, \n",
      "Ermolovs, Platovs, and Milo radoviches. Like Dokhturov \n",
      "he had the reputation of being a man of very limited War and Peace  \n",
      "2414 of 2882 \n",
      "capacity and information, and like Dokhturov he never \n",
      "made plans of battle but was always found where the \n",
      "situation was most difficult. Since his appointment as \n",
      "general on duty he had always  slept with his door open, \n",
      "giving orders that every me ssenger should be allowed to \n",
      "wake him up. In battle he wa s always under fire, so that \n",
      "Kutuzov reproved him for it a nd feared to send him to the \n",
      "front, and like Dokhturov he was one of those unnoticed \n",
      "cogwheels that, without clatte r or noise, constitute the \n",
      "most essential part of the machine. \n",
      "Coming out of the hut into the damp, dark night \n",
      "Konovnitsyn frowned- partly from an increased pain in \n",
      "his head and partly at the unpleasant thought that occurred \n",
      "to him, of how all that nest of influential men on the staff \n",
      "would be stirred up by this news, especially Bennigsen, \n",
      "who ever since Tarutino had been at daggers drawn with \n",
      "Kutuzov; and how they woul d make suggestions, quarrel, \n",
      "issue orders, and rescind them. And this premonition was \n",
      "disagreeable to him though he knew it could not be \n",
      "helped. \n",
      "And in fact Toll, to whom he went to communicate the \n",
      "news, immediately began to  expound his plans to a \n",
      "general sharing his quar ters, until Konovnitsyn, who \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2415 of 2882 \n",
      "listened in weary silence, re minded him that they must go \n",

      "2416 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XVII \n",
      "Kutuzov like all old people did not sleep much at \n",
      "night. He often fell asleep une xpectedly in the daytime, \n",
      "but at night, lying on hi s bed without undressing, he \n",
      "generally remained awake thinking. \n",
      "So he lay now on his bed, supporting his large, heavy, \n",
      "scarred head on his plump ha nd, with his one eye open, \n",
      "meditating and peering into the darkness. \n",
      "Since Bennigsen, who corresponded with the Emperor \n",
      "and had more influence than a nyone else on the staff, had \n",
      "begun to avoid him, Kutuzov was more at ease as to the \n",
      "possibility of himself and his troops being obliged to take \n",
      "part in useless aggressive movements. The lesson of the \n",
      "Tarutino battle and of the da y before it, which Kutuzov \n",
      "remembered with pain, must, he thought, have some \n",
      "effect on others too. \n",
      "‘They must understand that we can only lose by taking \n",
      "the offensive. Patience and time are my warriors, my \n",
      "champions,’ thought Kutuzov. He knew that an apple \n",
      "should not be plucked while it is green. It will fall of itself \n",
      "when ripe, but if picked unr ipe the apple is spoiled, the \n",
      "tree is harmed, and your teet h are set on edge. Like an \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2417 of 2882 \n",
      "experienced sportsman he knew that the beast was \n",
      "wounded, and wounded as only the whole strength of \n",
      "Russia could have wounded it, but whether it was \n",
      "mortally wounded or not was still an undecided question. \n",
      "Now by the fact of Lauriston and Barthelemi having been \n",
      "sent, and by the reports of the guerrillas, Kutuzov was \n",
      "almost sure that the wound was mortal. But he needed \n",
      "further proofs and it was necessary to wait. \n",
      "‘They want to run to see how they have wounded it. \n",
      "Wait and we shall see! Con tinual maneuvers, continual \n",
      "advances!’ thought he. ‘What fo r? Only to distinguish \n",
      "themselves! As if fighting were fun. They are like \n",
      "children from whom one can’t get any sensible account of \n",
      "what has happened because th ey all want to show how \n",
      "well they can fight. But that’s not what is needed now. \n",
      "‘And what ingenious maneuve rs they all propose to \n",
      "me! It seems to them that when they have thought of two \n",
      "or three contingencies’ (he remembered the general plan \n",
      "sent him from Petersburg) ‘they have foreseen everything. \n",
      "But the contingencies are endless.’ \n",
      "The undecided question as to whether the wound \n",
      "inflicted at Borodino was mortal or not had hung over \n",
      "Kutuzov’s head for a whole month. On the one hand the \n",
      "French had occupied Moscow. On the other Kutuzov felt War and Peace  \n",
      "2418 of 2882 \n",
      "assured with all his being that the terrible blow into which \n",
      "he and all the Russians had put their whole strength must \n",
      "have been mortal. But in an y case proofs were needed; he \n",
      "had waited a whole month for them and grew more \n",
      "impatient the longer he waited. Lying on his bed during \n",
      "those sleepless nights he did just what he reproached \n",
      "those younger generals for doing. He imagined all sorts of \n",
      "possible contingencies, just like the younger men, but \n",
      "with this difference, that he saw thousands of \n",
      "contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing \n",
      "on them. The longer he thought the more contingencies \n",
      "presented themselves. He imagined all sorts of \n",
      "movements of the Napoleonic army as a whole or in \n",
      "sections- against Petersburg, or against him, or to outflank \n",
      "him. He thought too of the po ssibility (which he feared \n",
      "most of all) that Napoleon might fight him with his own \n",
      "weapon and remain in Moscow awaiting him. Kutuzov \n",
      "even imagined that Napoleon’s army might turn back \n",
      "through Medyn and Yukhnov, but the one thing he could \n",
      "not foresee was what happene d- the insane, convulsive \n",
      "stampede of Napoleon’s army during its first eleven days \n",
      "after leaving Moscow: a stam pede which made possible \n",
      "what Kutuzov had not yet ev en dared to think of- the \n",

      "about Broussier’s division, th e guerrillas’ reports of \n",

      "leaving Moscow, all confirme d the supposition that the \n",
      "French army was beaten and preparing for flight. But \n",
      "these were only suppositions, wh ich seemed important to \n",
      "the younger men but not to Kutuzov. With his sixty years’ \n",
      "experience he knew what value to attach to rumors, knew \n",
      "how apt people who desire a nything are to group all news \n",
      "so that it appears to confirm what they desire, and he \n",
      "knew how readily in such cases  they omit all that makes \n",
      "for the contrary. And the more  he desired it the less he \n",
      "allowed himself to believe it. This question absorbed all \n",
      "his mental powers. All else was to him only life’s \n",
      "customary routine. To such customary routine belonged \n",

      "Tarutino to Madame de Stael, the reading of novels, the \n",
      "distribution of awards, his correspondence with \n",
      "Petersburg, and so on. But the destruction of the French, \n",

      "On the night of the eleventh  of October he lay leaning \n",
      "on his arm and thinking of that. \n",

      "hundreds of seemingly merry French voices shouting \n",
      "together came up from the sl ope. For a moment Denisov \n",
      "and the esaul drew back. They were so near that they \n",
      "thought they were the cause of the firing and shouting. \n",
      "But the firing and shouting di d not relate to them. Down \n",
      "below, a man wearing something red was running through \n",
      "the marsh. The French were evidently firing and shouting \n",
      "at him. \n",
      "‘Why, that’s our Tikhon,’ said the esaul. \n",
      "‘So it is! It is!’ \n",
      "‘The wascal!’ said Denisov. \n",
      "‘He’ll get away!’ said the esaul, screwing up his eyes. \n",
      "The man whom they called Tikhon, having run to the \n",
      "stream, plunged in so that the water splashed in the air, \n",
      "and, having disappeared for an instant, scrambled out on War and Peace  \n",
      "2458 of 2882 \n",
      "all fours, all black with th e wet, and ran on. The French \n",
      "who had been pursuing him stopped. \n",
      "‘Smart, that!’ said the esaul. \n",
      "‘What a beast!’ said Denisov with his former look of \n",
      "vexation. ‘What has he been doing all this time?’ \n",
      "‘Who is he?’ asked Petya. \n",
      "‘He’s our plastun. I sent him to capture a ‘tongue.’’ \n",
      "‘Oh, yes,’ said Petya, nodding at the first words \n",
      "Denisov uttered as if he understood it all, though he really \n",
      "did not understand anything of it. \n",
      "Tikhon Shcherbaty was one of  the most indispensable \n",
      "men in their band. He was a peasant from Pokrovsk, near \n",
      "the river Gzhat. When Denisov had come to Pokrovsk at \n",
      "the beginning of his operations and had as usual \n",
      "summoned the village elder a nd asked him what he knew \n",
      "about the French, the elder, as though shielding himself, \n",
      "had replied, as all village el ders did, that he had neither \n",
      "seen nor heard anything of  them. But when Denisov \n",
      "explained that his purpose was to kill the French, and \n",
      "asked if no French had straye d that way, the elder replied \n",
      "that some ‘more-orderers’ had really been at their village, \n",
      "but that Tikhon Shcherbaty was the only man who dealt \n",
      "with such matters. Denisov had Tikhon called and, having \n",
      "praised him for his activity, said a few words in the \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2459 of 2882 \n",
      "elder’s presence about loyalty to the Tsar and the country \n",
      "and the hatred of the French th at all sons of the fatherland \n",
      "should cherish. \n",
      "‘We don’t do the French any harm,’ said Tikhon, \n",
      "evidently frightened by Denisov’s words. ‘We only fooled \n",
      "about with the lads for fun, you know! We killed a score \n",
      "or so of ‘more-orderers,’ but we did no harm else..’ \n",
      "Next day when Denisov had left Pokrovsk, having \n",
      "quite forgotten about this peas ant, it was reported to him \n",
      "that Tikhon had attached himsel f to their party and asked \n",
      "to be allowed to remain with it. Denisov gave orders to let \n",
      "him do so. \n",
      "Tikhon, who at first did rough work, laying campfires, \n",
      "fetching water, flaying dead horses, and so on, soon \n",
      "showed a great liking and aptitude for partisan warfare. At \n",
      "night he would go out for booty and always brought back \n",
      "French clothing and weapons, and when told to would \n",
      "bring in French captives also. Denisov then relieved him \n",
      "from drudgery and began taking him with him when he \n",
      "went out on expeditions a nd had him enrolled among the \n",
      "Cossacks. \n",
      "Tikhon did not like riding, and always went on foot, \n",
      "never lagging behind the cavalry. He was armed with a \n",
      "musketoon (which he carried rath er as a joke), a pike and War and Peace  \n",
      "2460 of 2882 \n",
      "an ax, which latter he used as a wolf uses its teeth, with \n",
      "equal case picking fleas out of  its fur or crunching thick \n",
      "bones. Tikhon with equal accuracy would split logs with \n",
      "blows at arm’s length, or holding the head of the ax would \n",
      "cut thin little pegs or carv e spoons. In Denisov’s party he \n",
      "held a peculiar and exceptional position. When anything \n",
      "particularly difficult or nasty had to be done- to push a \n",
      "cart out of the mud with one’s shoulders, pull a horse out \n",
      "of a swamp by its tail, skin it, slink in among the French, \n",
      "or walk more than thirty  miles in a day- everybody \n",
      "pointed laughingly at Tikhon. \n",
      "‘It won’t hurt that devil- he’s as strong as a horse!’ \n",
      "they said of him. \n",
      "Once a Frenchman Tikhon was trying to capture fired a \n",
      "pistol at him and shot him in  the fleshy part of the back. \n",
      "That wound (which Tikhon trea ted only with internal and \n",
      "external applications of vodka) was the subject of the \n",

      "Tikhon readily joined. \n",
      "‘Hallo, mate! Never again? Gave you a twist?’ the \n",
      "Cossacks would banter him. And Tikhon, purposely \n",
      "writhing and making faces, pretended to be angry and \n",

      "2461 of 2882 \n",
      "effect of this incident on Tikhon was that after being \n",
      "wounded he seldom brought in prisoners. \n",
      "He was the bravest and most useful man in the party. \n",
      "No one found more opportunitie s for attacking, no one \n",
      "captured or killed more Frenchmen, and consequently he \n",
      "was made the buffoon of all the Cossacks and hussars and \n",
      "willingly accepted that role. Now he had been sent by \n",
      "Denisov overnight to Shamshevo to capture a ‘tongue.’ \n",
      "But whether because he had not  been content to take only \n",
      "one Frenchman or because he had slept through the night, \n",
      "he had crept by day into some bushes right among the \n",
      "French and, as Denisov ha d witnessed from above, had \n",
      "been detected by them. War and Peace  \n",
      "2462 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter VI \n",
      "After talking for some time with the esaul about next \n",
      "day’s attack, which now, seeing how near they were to the \n",
      "French, he seemed to have definitely decided on, Denisov \n",
      "turned his horse and rode back. \n",
      "‘Now, my lad, we’ll go and get dwy,’ he said to Petya. \n",
      "As they approached the watchhouse Denisov stopped, \n",
      "peering into the forest. Among the trees a man with long \n",
      "legs and long, swinging arms, wearing a short jacket, bast \n",
      "shoes, and a Kazan hat, was approaching with long, light \n",
      "steps. He had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax \n",
      "stuck in his girdle. When he espied Denisov he hastily \n",
      "threw something into the bushes, removed his sodden hat \n",
      "by its floppy brim, and approached his commander. It was \n",
      "Tikhon. His wrinkled and pockmarked face and narrow \n",
      "little eyes beamed with self-s atisfied merriment. He lifted \n",
      "his head high and gazed at De nisov as if repressing a \n",
      "laugh. \n",
      "‘Well, where did you disappear to?’ inquired Denisov. \n",
      "‘Where did I disappear to? I went to get Frenchmen,’ \n",
      "answered Tikhon boldly and hurriedly, in a husky but \n",
      "melodious bass voice. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2463 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Why did you push yourself in there by daylight? You \n",
      "ass! Well, why haven’t you taken one?’ \n",
      "‘Oh, I took one all right,’ said Tikhon. \n",
      "‘Where is he?’ \n",
      "‘You see, I took him first thing at dawn,’ Tikhon \n",
      "continued, spreading out his fl at feet with outturned toes \n",
      "in their bast shoes. ‘I took him into the forest. Then I see \n",
      "he’s no good and think I’ll go and fetch a likelier one.’ \n",
      "‘You see?... What a wogue- it’s just as I thought,’ said \n",
      "Denisov to the esaul. ‘Why didn’t you bwing that one?’ \n",
      "‘What was the good of bringing him?’ Tikhon \n",
      "interrupted hastily and angril y- ‘that one wouldn’t have \n",
      "done for you. As if I don’t know what sort you want!’ \n",
      "‘What a bwute you are!... Well?’ \n",
      "‘I went for another one, ’ Tikhon continued, ‘and I \n",
      "crept like this through th e wood and lay down.’ (He \n",
      "suddenly lay down on his stomach with a supple \n",
      "movement to show how he had done it.) ‘One turned up \n",
      "and I grabbed him, like this.’  (He jumped up quickly and \n",
      "lightly.) ‘‘Come along to the colonel,’ I said. He starts \n",
      "yelling, and suddenly there we re four of them. They \n",
      "rushed at me with their little  swords. So I went for them \n",
      "with my ax, this way: ‘What are you up to?’ says I. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2464 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Christ be with you!’’ shouted Tikhon, waving his arms \n",
      "with an angry scowl and throwing out his chest. \n",
      "‘Yes, we saw from the hill how you took to your heels \n",
      "through the puddles!’ said the esaul, screwing up his \n",
      "glittering eyes. \n",
      "Petya badly wanted to laugh, but noticed that they all \n",
      "refrained from laughing. He turned his eyes rapidly from \n",
      "Tikhon’s face to the esaul’s and Denisov’s, unable to \n",
      "make out what it all meant. \n",
      "‘Don’t play the fool!’ said Denisov, coughing angrily. \n",
      "‘Why didn’t you bwing the first one?’ \n",
      "Tikhon scratched his back w ith one hand and his head \n",
      "with the other, then suddenly his whole face expanded \n",
      "into a beaming, foolish grin, disclosing a gap where he \n",
      "had lost a tooth (that was w hy he was called Shcherbaty- \n",
      "the gap-toothed). Denisov sm iled, and Petya burst into a \n",
      "peal of merry laughter in which Tikhon himself joined. \n",
      "‘Oh, but he was a regular  good-for-nothing,’ said \n",
      "Tikhon. ‘The clothes on him-  poor stuff! How could I \n",
      "bring him? And so rude, your honor! Why, he says: ‘I’m a \n",
      "general’s son myself, I won’t go!’ he says.’ \n",
      "‘You are a bwute!’ said Denisov. ‘I wanted to \n",
      "question..’ \n",

      "2465 of 2882 \n",
      "‘But I questioned him,’ said Tikhon. ‘He said he didn’t \n",

      "stuff- only soldiers in name,’ he says. ‘Shout loud at \n",
      "them,’ he says, ‘and you’ll take them all,’’ Tikhon \n",
      "concluded, looking cheerfu lly and resolu tely into \n",
      "Denisov’s eyes. \n",
      "‘I’ll give you a hundwed sharp lashes- that’ll teach you \n",

      "‘Well, let’s go,’ said Denisov, and rode all the way to \n",

      "When the fit of laughter that had seized him at \n",
      "Tikhon’s words and smile had passed and Petya realized \n",
      "for a moment that this Ti khon had killed a man, he felt \n",
      "uneasy. He looked round at the captive drummer boy and \n",
      "felt a pang in his heart. But this uneasiness lasted only a \n",
      "moment. He felt it necessary to hold his head higher, to \n",
      "brace himself, and to question the esaul with an air of War and Peace  \n",
      "2466 of 2882 \n",
      "importance about tomorrow’s undertaking, that he might \n",
      "not be unworthy of the co mpany in which he found \n",
      "himself. \n",
      "The officer who had been se nt to inquire met Denisov \n",
      "on the way with the news that Dolokhov was soon coming \n",
      "and that all was well with him. \n",

      "Chapter VII \n",
      "Petya, having left his people after their departure from \n",
      "Moscow, joined his regime nt and was soon taken as \n",
      "orderly by a general commanding a large guerrilla \n",
      "detachment. From the time he received his commission, \n",
      "and especially since he had joined the active army and \n",
      "taken part in the battle of Vyazma, Petya had been in a \n",
      "constant state of blissful excitement at being grown-up \n",
      "and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to miss any chance to \n",
      "do something really heroic. He  was highly de lighted with \n",
      "what he saw and experienced in the army, but at the same \n",
      "time it always seemed to him that the really heroic \n",
      "exploits were being performed just where he did not \n",
      "happen to be. And he was alwa ys in a hurry to get where \n",
      "he was not. \n",
      "When on the twenty-first of October his general \n",
      "expressed a wish to send somebody to Denisov’s \n",
      "detachment, Petya begged so pi teously to be sent that the \n",
      "general could not refuse. Bu t when dispatching him he \n",
      "recalled Petya’s mad action at  the battle of Vyazma, \n",
      "where instead of riding by the road to the place to which \n",
      "he had been sent, he had galloped to the advanced line War and Peace  \n",
      "2468 of 2882 \n",
      "under the fire of the French and had there twice fired his \n",
      "pistol. So now the general explicitly forbade his taking \n",
      "part in any action whatever of Denisov’s. That was why \n",
      "Petya had blushed and grown confused when Denisov \n",
      "asked him whether he could st ay. Before they had ridden \n",
      "to the outskirts of the forest Petya had considered he must \n",
      "carry out his instructions stri ctly and return at once. But \n",
      "when he saw the French and saw Tikhon and learned that \n",
      "there would certainly be an a ttack that night, he decided, \n",
      "with the rapidity with which young people change their \n",
      "views, that the general, whom he had greatly respected till \n",
      "then, was a rubbishy German, that Denisov was a hero, \n",
      "the esaul a hero, and Tikhon a hero too, and that it would \n",
      "be shameful for him to leave them at a moment of \n",
      "difficulty. \n",
      "It was already growing dusk when Denisov, Petya, and \n",
      "the esaul rode up to the wa tchhouse. In the twilight \n",
      "saddled horses could be seen, and Cossacks and hussars \n",
      "who had rigged up rough shelte rs in the glade and were \n",
      "kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the \n",
      "French could not see the smoke. In the passage of the \n",
      "small watchhouse a Cossack wi th sleeves rolled up was \n",
      "chopping some mutton. In the room three officers of \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2469 of 2882 \n",
      "Petya took off his wet clothes, gave them to be dried, and \n",
      "at once began helping the officers to fix up the dinner \n",
      "table. \n",
      "In ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread \n",
      "on it. On the table were vodka, a flask of rum, white \n",
      "bread, roast mutton, and salt. \n",
      "Sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat \n",
      "savory mutton with his hands, down which the grease \n",
      "trickled, Petya was in an ecstatic childish state of love for \n",
      "all men, and consequently of confidence that others loved \n",
      "him in the same way. \n",
      "‘So then what do you think, Va sili Dmitrich?’ said he \n",
      "to Denisov. ‘It’s all right my staying a day with you?’ \n",
      "And not waiting for a repl y he answered his own \n",
      "question: ‘You see I was told  to find out- well, I am \n",
      "finding out.... Only do let me into the very... into the \n",
      "chief... I don’t want a reward... But I want..’ \n",
      "Petya clenched his teet h and looked around, throwing \n",
      "back his head and flourishing his arms. \n",
      "‘Into the vewy chief...’ Denisov repeated with a smile. \n",
      "‘Only, please let me command something, so that I \n",
      "may really command...’ Petya went on. ‘What would it be \n",
      "to you?... Oh, you want a knif e?’ he said, turning to an \n",
      "officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton. War and Peace  \n",
      "2470 of 2882 \n",
      "And he handed him his clasp knife. The officer \n",
      "admired it. \n",
      "‘Please keep it. I have several like it,’ said Petya, \n",
      "blushing. ‘Heavens! I was quite  forgetting!’ he suddenly \n",
      "cried. ‘I have some raisins, fine ones; you know, seedless \n",
      "ones. We have a new sutler and he has such capital things. \n",
      "I bought ten pounds. I am used to something sweet. \n",
      "Would you like some?...’ and Petya ran out into the \n",
      "passage to his Cossack and brought back some bags \n",
      "which contained about five pounds of raisins. ‘Have \n",
      "some, gentlemen, have some!’ \n",
      "‘You want a coffeepot, don’t you?’ he asked the esaul. \n",
      "‘I bought a capital on e from our sutler! He has splendid \n",
      "things. And he’s very honest, that’s the chief thing. I’ll be \n",
      "sure to send it to you. Or pe rhaps your flints are giving \n",
      "out, or are worn out- that happens sometimes, you know. I \n",
      "have brought some with me, here they are’- and he \n",
      "showed a bag- ‘a hundred flints. I bought them very \n",
      "cheap. Please take as many as you want, or all if you \n",
      "like...’ \n",
      "Then suddenly, dismayed lest he had said too much, \n",
      "Petya stopped and blushed. \n",
      "He tried to remember whether he had not done \n",
      "anything else that was f oolish. And running over the \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2471 of 2882 \n",
      "events of the day he remembered the French drummer \n",
      "boy. ‘It’s capital for us here, but what of him? Where \n",
      "have they put him? Have they fed him? Haven’t they hurt \n",
      "his feelings?’ he thought. But having caught himself \n",
      "saying too much about the flin ts, he was now afraid to \n",
      "speak out. \n",
      "‘I might ask,’ he thought, ‘but they’ll say: ‘He’s a boy \n",
      "himself and so he pities the boy.’ I’ll show them \n",
      "tomorrow whether I’m a boy. Will it seem odd if I ask?’ \n",
      "Petya thought. ‘Well, never mind!’ and immediately, \n",
      "blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if \n",
      "they appeared ironical, he said: \n",
      "‘May I call in that boy who was taken prisoner and \n",
      "give him something to eat?... Perhaps..’ \n",
      "‘Yes, he’s a poor little fe llow,’ said Denisov, who \n",
      "evidently saw nothing shameful in this reminder. ‘Call \n",
      "him in. His name is Vincent Bosse. Have him fetched.’ \n",
      "‘I’ll call him,’ said Petya. \n",
      "‘Yes, yes, call him. A poor little fellow,’ Denisov \n",
      "repeated. \n",
      "Petya was standing at the door when Denisov said this. \n",
      "He slipped in between the officers, came close to \n",
      "Denisov, and said: War and Peace  \n",
      "2472 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Let me kiss you, dear old fellow! Oh, how fine, how \n",
      "splendid!’ \n",
      "And having kissed Denisov he ran out of the hut. \n",
      "‘Bosse! Vincent!’ Petya cr ied, stopping outside the \n",

      "‘Ah, Vesenny?’ said a Cossack. \n",
      "Vincent, the boy’s name, had already been changed by \n",
      "the Cossacks into Vesenny (ver nal) and into Vesenya by \n",
      "the peasants and soldiers. In both these adaptations the \n",

      "by the young lad. \n",

      "*\"Thank you, sir.’ \n",

      "way of speaking and everything he did indicated his \n",

      "2476 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Why not?’ Dolokhov answered absently, scrutinizing \n",

      "‘Where? I send them away and take a weceipt for \n",
      "them,’ shouted Denisov, suddenly flushing. ‘And I say \n",

      "pleasure in speaking of this subject which irritated \n",
      "Denisov. ‘Now, why have you kept this lad?’ he went on, \n",
      "swaying his head. ‘Because you are sorry for him! Don’t \n",
      "we know those ‘receipts’ of yours? You send a hundred \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2477 of 2882 \n",
      "men away, and thirty get there. The rest either starve or \n",
      "get killed. So isn’t it all the same not to send them?’ \n",
      "The esaul, screwing up his light-colored eyes, nodded \n",
      "approvingly. \n",
      "‘That’s not the point. I’m  not going to discuss the \n",
      "matter. I do not wish to take it on my conscience. You say \n",
      "they’ll die. All wight. Only not by my fault!’ \n",
      "Dolokhov began laughing. \n",
      "‘Who has told them not to capture me these twenty \n",
      "times over? But if they did catch me they’d string me up \n",

      "While Dolokhov had been disputing with Denisov \n",
      "what should be done with prisoners, Petya had once more \n",

      "Dolokhov. If he can, so can I!’ \n",
      "And to all Denisov’s persuasions, Petya replied that he \n",
      "too was accustomed to do everything accurately and not \n",
      "just anyhow, and that he never considered personal \n",
      "danger. \n",
      "‘For you’ll admit that if we don’t know for sure how \n",

      "On reaching the bottom, Dolokhov told the Cossacks \n",

      "‘If we’re caught, I won’t be  taken alive! I have a \n",

      "*\"Who goes there?’ \n",
      "The blood rushed to Petya’s face and he grasped his \n",

      "big blazing campfire, around which sat several men \n",
      "talking noisily. Something was boiling in a small cauldron \n",
      "at the edge of the fire and a soldier in a peaked cap and \n",

      "2482 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Is that you, Clement?’ he asked. ‘Where the devil...? \n",
      "But, noticing his mistake, he broke off short and, with a \n",
      "frown, greeted Dolokhov as a stranger, asking what he \n",

      "Dolokhov said that he and his companion were trying \n",
      "to overtake their regiment, and addressing the company in \n",
      "general asked whether they knew anything of the 6th \n",
      "Regiment. None of them knew anything, and Petya \n",

      "take his eyes from Dolokhov and again asked to what \n",
      "regiment he belonged. Dol okhov, as if he had not heard \n",
      "the question, did not reply, but lighting a short French \n",
      "pipe which he took from his pocket began asking the \n",

      "2483 of 2882 \n",
      "officer in how far the road before them was safe from \n",

      "‘Well, now he’ll come away,’ Petya thought every \n",
      "moment as he stood by the campfire listening to the talk. \n",

      "dropped and began putting direct questions as to how \n",
      "many men there were in the battalion, how many \n",
      "battalions, and how many pris oners. Asking about the \n",
      "Russian prisoners with that detachment, Dolokhov said: \n",
      "‘A horrid business dragging these corpses about with \n",

      "into loud laughter, so stra nge that Petya thought the \n",

      "afterwards. I don’t like that.’ \n",
      "‘Just so,’ said the Cossack. \n",
      "‘Oh yes, another thing! Please, my dear fellow, will \n",
      "you sharpen my saber for me? It ’s got bl...’ (Petya feared \n",
      "to tell a lie, and the sabe r never had been sharpened.) \n",
      "‘Can you do it?’ \n",
      "‘Of course I can.’ \n",
      "Likhachev got up, rummaged in his pack, and soon \n",
      "Petya heard the warlike sound of steel on whetstone. He \n",
      "climbed onto the wagon and sat on its edge. The Cossack \n",
      "was sharpening the saber under the wagon. \n",
      "‘I say! Are the lads asleep?’ asked Petya. \n",
      "‘Some are, and some aren’t- like us.’ \n",
      "‘Well, and that boy?’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2489 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Vesenny? Oh, he’s thrown himself down there in the \n",
      "passage. Fast asleep after his fright. He was that glad!’ \n",
      "After that Petya remained silent for a long time, \n",
      "listening to the sounds. He heard footsteps in the darkness \n",
      "and a black figure appeared. \n",
      "‘What are you sharpening?’ asked a man coming up to \n",
      "the wagon. \n",
      "‘Why, this gentleman’s saber.’ \n",
      "‘That’s right,’ said the man, whom Petya took to be an \n",
      "hussar. ‘Was the cup left here?’ \n",
      "‘There, by the wheel!’ \n",
      "The hussar took the cup. \n",
      "‘It must be daylight soon,’ said he, yawning, and went \n",
      "away. \n",
      "Petya ought to have known that he was in a forest with \n",
      "Denisov’s guerrilla band, less than a mile from the road, \n",
      "sitting on a wagon captured from the French beside which \n",
      "horses were tethered, that under it Likhachev was sitting \n",
      "sharpening a saber for him, that the big dark blotch to the \n",
      "right was the watchman’s hut, and the red blotch below to \n",
      "the left was the dying embers of a campfire, that the man \n",
      "who had come for the cup was an hussar who wanted a \n",
      "drink; but he neither knew nor waited to know anything of \n",
      "all this. He was in a fairy kingdom where nothing War and Peace  \n",
      "2490 of 2882 \n",
      "resembled reality. The big dark blotch might really be the \n",
      "watchman’s hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very \n",
      "depths of the earth. Perhaps th e red spot was a fire, or it \n",
      "might be the eye of an enormous monster. Perhaps he was \n",
      "really sitting on a wagon, but it might very well be that he \n",
      "was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high tower \n",
      "from which, if he fell, he w ould have to fall for a whole \n",
      "day or a whole month, or go on falling and never reach \n",
      "the bottom. Perhaps it was just the Cossack, Likhachev, \n",
      "who was sitting under the wagon, but it might be the \n",
      "kindest, bravest, most wonderful, most splendid man in \n",
      "the world, whom no one knew of. It might really have \n",
      "been that the hussar came for water and went back into \n",
      "the hollow, but perhaps he had simply vanished- \n",
      "disappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness. \n",
      "Nothing Petya could have seen now would have \n",
      "surprised him. He was in a fairy kingdom where \n",
      "everything was possible. \n",
      "He looked up at the sky. And the sky was a fairy realm \n",
      "like the earth. It was cleari ng, and over the tops of the \n",
      "trees clouds were swiftly saili ng as if unveiling the stars. \n",
      "Sometimes it looked as if the clouds were passing, and a \n",
      "clear black sky appeared. Some times it seemed as if the \n",
      "black spaces were clouds. Sometimes the sky seemed to \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2491 of 2882 \n",
      "be rising high, high overhead, and then it seemed to sink \n",
      "so low that one could touch it with one’s hand. \n",
      "Petya’s eyes began to close and he swayed a little. \n",
      "The trees were dripping. Quiet talking was heard. The \n",
      "horses neighed and jostled one another. Someone snored. \n",
      "‘Ozheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg...’ hissed the saber against \n",
      "the whetstone, and suddenly Petya heard an harmonious \n",
      "orchestra playing some unknown, sweetly solemn hymn. \n",
      "Petya was as musical as Natasha and more so than \n",
      "Nicholas, but had never learned music or thought about it, \n",
      "and so the melody that unexp ectedly came to his mind \n",
      "seemed to him particularly fresh and attractive. The music \n",
      "became more and more audible. The melody grew and \n",
      "passed from one instrument to another. And what was \n",
      "played was a fugue- though Petya had not the least \n",
      "conception of what a fugue is. Each instrument- now \n",
      "resembling a violin and now a horn, but better and clearer \n",
      "than violin or horn- played its own part, and before it had \n",
      "finished the melody merged w ith another instrument that \n",
      "began almost the same air, and then with a third and a \n",
      "fourth; and they all blende d into one and again became \n",
      "separate and again blended, now into solemn church \n",
      "music, now into something dazzlingly brilliant and \n",
      "triumphant. War and Peace  \n",
      "2492 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Oh- why, that was in a dream!’ Petya said to himself, \n",
      "as he lurched forward. ‘It’s in my ears. But perhaps it’s \n",
      "music of my own. Well, go on, my music! Now!..’ \n",
      "He closed his eyes, and, from all sides as if from a \n",
      "distance, sounds fluttered, grew into harmonies, \n",
      "separated, blended, and again all mingled into the same \n",
      "sweet and solemn hymn. ‘Oh, this is delightful! As much \n",
      "as I like and as I like!’ said Petya to himself. He tried to \n",
      "conduct that enormous orchestra. \n",
      "‘Now softly, softly die away!’ and the sounds obeyed \n",
      "him. ‘Now fuller, more j oyful. Still more and more \n",
      "joyful!’ And from an unknow n depth rose increasingly \n",
      "triumphant sounds. ‘Now voices join in!’ ordered Petya. \n",
      "And at first from afar he heard men’s voices and then \n",
      "women’s. The voices grew in harmonious triumphant \n",
      "strength, and Petya listened to their surpassing beauty in \n",
      "awe and joy. \n",
      "With a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song, \n",
      "the drip from the trees, a nd the hissing of the saber, \n",
      "‘Ozheg-zheg-zheg...’ and ag ain the horses jostled one \n",
      "another and neighed, not dist urbing the choir but joining \n",
      "in it. \n",
      "Petya did not know how long this lasted: he enjoyed \n",
      "himself all the time, wondered at his enjoyment and \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2493 of 2882 \n",
      "regretted that there was no one to share it. He was \n",
      "awakened by Likhachev’s kindly voice. \n",
      "‘It’s ready, your honor; you can split a Frenchman in \n",
      "half with it!’ \n",
      "Petya woke up. \n",
      "‘It’s getting light, it’s r eally getting light!’ he \n",
      "exclaimed. \n",
      "The horses that had previous ly been invisible could \n",
      "now be seen to their very tails, and a watery light showed \n",
      "itself through the bare bran ches. Petya shook himself, \n",
      "jumped up, took a ruble from his pocket and gave it to \n",
      "Likhachev; then he flourished the saber, tested it, and \n",
      "sheathed it. The Cossacks were untying their horses and \n",
      "tightening their saddle girths. \n",
      "‘And here’s the commander,’ said Likhachev. \n",
      "Denisov came out of the wa tchman’s hut and, having \n",
      "called Petya, gave orders to get ready. War and Peace  \n",
      "2494 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XI \n",
      "The men rapidly picked out their horses in the \n",
      "semidarkness, tightened their saddle girths, and formed \n",
      "companies. Denisov stood by the watchman’s hut giving \n",
      "final orders. The infantry of  the detachment passed along \n",
      "the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the \n",
      "mist of early dawn, hundreds of feet splashing through the \n",
      "mud. The esaul gave some orde rs to his men. Petya held \n",
      "his horse by the bridle, impa tiently awaiting the order to \n",
      "mount. His face, having been bathed in cold water, was \n",
      "all aglow, and his eyes were particularly brilliant. Cold \n",
      "shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed \n",
      "rhythmically. \n",
      "‘Well, is ev’wything weady?’ asked Denisov. ‘Bwing \n",
      "the horses.’ \n",
      "The horses were brought. De nisov was angry with the \n",
      "Cossack because the saddle girths were too slack, \n",
      "reproved him, and mounted. Petya put his foot in the \n",
      "stirrup. His horse by habit made as if to nip his leg, but \n",
      "Petya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his \n",
      "own weight and, turning to l ook at the hussars starting in \n",
      "the darkness behind him, rode up to Denisov. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2495 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Vasili Dmitrich, entrust me with some commission! \n",
      "Please... for God’s sake...!’ said he. \n",
      "Denisov seemed to have forgotten Petya’s very \n",
      "existence. He turned to glance at him. \n",
      "‘I ask one thing of you,’ he said sternly, ‘to obey me \n",
      "and not shove yourself forward anywhere.’ \n",
      "He did not say another word to Petya but rode in \n",
      "silence all the way. When they had come to the edge of \n",
      "the forest it was noticeably growing light over the field. \n",
      "Denisov talked in whispers with the esaul and the \n",
      "Cossacks rode past Petya and Denisov. When they had all \n",
      "ridden by, Denisov touched hi s horse and rode down the \n",
      "hill. Slipping onto their ha unches and sliding, the horses \n",
      "descended with their riders into the ravine. Petya rode \n",
      "beside Denisov, the pulsat ion of his body constantly \n",
      "increasing. It was getting lighter and lighter, but the mist \n",
      "still hid distant objects. Having reached the valley, \n",
      "Denisov looked back and nodded to a Cossack beside \n",
      "him. \n",
      "‘The signal!’ said he. \n",
      "The Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out. In an \n",
      "instant the tramp of horses galloping forward was heard, \n",
      "shouts came from various sides, and then more shots. War and Peace  \n",
      "2496 of 2882 \n",
      "At the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting, \n",
      "Petya lashed his horse and loosening his rein galloped \n",
      "forward, not heeding Denisov who shouted at him. It \n",
      "seemed to Petya that at the moment the shot was fired it \n",
      "suddenly became as bright as noon. He galloped to the \n",
      "bridge. Cossacks were galloping along the road in front of \n",
      "him. On the bridge he collided with a Cossack who had \n",
      "fallen behind, but he galloped on. In front of him soldiers, \n",
      "probably Frenchmen, were running from right to left \n",
      "across the road. One of them fell in the mud under his \n",
      "horse’s feet. \n",
      "Cossacks were crowding about a hut, busy with \n",
      "something. From the midst of that crowd terrible screams \n",
      "arose. Petya galloped up, and the first thing he saw was \n",
      "the pale face and trembling jaw of a Frenchman, clutching \n",
      "the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him. \n",
      "‘Hurrah!... Lads!... ours!’ shouted Petya, and giving \n",
      "rein to his excited horse he galloped forward along the \n",
      "village street. \n",
      "He could hear shooting ahead of him. Cossacks, \n",
      "hussars, and ragged Russian prisoners, who had come \n",
      "running from both sides of the road, were shouting \n",
      "something loudly and incoherently. A gallant-looking \n",
      "Frenchman, in a blue overcoat, capless, and with a \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2497 of 2882 \n",
      "frowning red face, had been defending himself against the \n",
      "hussars. When Petya galloped up the Frenchman had \n",
      "already fallen. ‘Too late agai n!’ flashed through Petya’s \n",
      "mind and he galloped on to the place from which the \n",
      "rapid firing could be heard. Th e shots came from the yard \n",
      "of the landowner’s house he ha d visited the night before \n",
      "with Dolokhov. The French were making a stand there \n",
      "behind a wattle fence in a gard en thickly overgrown with \n",
      "bushes and were firing at th e Cossacks who crowded at \n",
      "the gateway. Through the smoke, as he approached the \n",
      "gate, Petya saw Dolokhov, whose face was of a pale-\n",
      "greenish tint, shouting to his men. ‘Go round! Wait for the \n",
      "infantry!’ he exclaimed as Petya rode up to him. \n",
      "‘Wait?... Hurrah-ah-ah!’ shout ed Petya, and without \n",
      "pausing a moment galloped to the place whence came the \n",
      "sounds of firing and where the smoke was thickest. \n",
      "A volley was heard, and some bullets whistled past, \n",
      "while others plashed against something. The Cossacks \n",
      "and Dolokhov galloped after Petya into the gateway of the \n",
      "courtyard. In the dense wavering smoke some of the \n",
      "French threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to \n",
      "meet the Cossacks, while others ran down the hill toward \n",
      "the pond. Petya was galloping along the courtyard, but \n",
      "instead of holding the reins he  waved both his arms about War and Peace  \n",
      "2498 of 2882 \n",
      "rapidly and strangely, slipping farther and farther to one \n",
      "side in his saddle. His hor se, having galloped up to a \n",
      "campfire that was smoldering in the morning light, \n",
      "stopped suddenly, and Petya fell heavily on to the wet \n",
      "ground. The Cossacks saw that his arms and legs jerked \n",
      "rapidly though his head was quite motionless. A bullet \n",
      "had pierced his skull. \n",
      "After speaking to the senior  French officer, who came \n",
      "out of the house with a white handkerchief tied to his \n",
      "sword and announced that they surrendered, Dolokhov \n",
      "dismounted and went up to Petya, who lay motionless \n",
      "with outstretched arms. \n",
      "‘Done for!’ he said with a frown, and went to the gate \n",
      "to meet Denisov who was riding toward him. \n",
      "‘Killed?’ cried Denisov, recognizing from a distance \n",
      "the unmistakably lifeless attitude- very familiar to him- in \n",
      "which Petya’s body was lying. \n",
      "‘Done for!’ repeated Dolokhov as if the utterance of \n",
      "these words afforded him pleasure, and he went quickly \n",
      "up to the prisoners, who were surrounded by Cossacks \n",
      "who had hurried up. ‘We won’t take them!’ he called out \n",
      "to Denisov. \n",
      "Denisov did not reply; he rode up to Petya, \n",
      "dismounted, and with tremb ling hands turned toward \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2499 of 2882 \n",
      "himself the bloodstained, mud-bespattered face which had \n",
      "already gone white. \n",
      "‘I am used to something sweet. Raisins, fine ones... \n",
      "take them all!’ he recalle d Petya’s words. And the \n",
      "Cossacks looked round in surpri se at the sound, like the \n",
      "yelp of a dog, with which Denisov turned away, walked to \n",
      "the wattle fence, and seized hold of it. \n",

      "all unhappiness arises not fr om privation but from \n",
      "superfluity. And now during these last three weeks of the \n",
      "march he had learned still anot her new, consolatory truth- \n",
      "that nothing in this world is terrible. He had learned that \n",
      "as there is no condition in which man can be happy and \n",
      "entirely free, so there is no condition in which he need be War and Peace  \n",
      "2504 of 2882 \n",
      "unhappy and lack freedom. He learned that suffering and \n",
      "freedom have their limits and that those limits are very \n",
      "near together; that the person in a bed of roses with one \n",
      "crumpled petal suffered as k eenly as he now, sleeping on \n",
      "the bare damp earth with one  side growing chilled while \n",
      "the other was warming; and that when he had put on tight \n",
      "dancing shoes he had suffered ju st as he did now when he \n",
      "walked with bare feet that were covered with sores- his \n",
      "footgear having long since fallen to pieces. He discovered \n",
      "that when he had married his wife- of his own free will as \n",
      "it had seemed to him- he had been no more free than now \n",
      "when they locked him up at night in a stable. Of all that \n",
      "he himself subsequently term ed his sufferings, but which \n",
      "at the time he scarcely felt, the worst was the state of his \n",
      "bare, raw, and scab-covered  feet. (The horseflesh was \n",
      "appetizing and nourishing, the saltpeter flavor of the \n",
      "gunpowder they used instead of salt was even pleasant; \n",
      "there was no great cold, it was always warm walking in \n",
      "the daytime, and at night there were the campfires; the \n",
      "lice that devoured him warm ed his body.) The one thing \n",
      "that was at first hard to bear was his feet. \n",
      "After the second day’s march Pierre, having examined \n",
      "his feet by the campfire, thought it would be impossible to \n",
      "walk on them; but when ev erybody got up he went along, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2505 of 2882 \n",
      "limping, and, when he had warmed up, walked without \n",
      "feeling the pain, though at night his feet were more \n",
      "terrible to look at than before. However, he did not look at \n",
      "them now, but thought of other things. \n",
      "Only now did Pierre realize the full strength of life in \n",
      "man and the saving power he has of transferring his \n",
      "attention from one thing to another, which is like the \n",
      "safety valve of a boiler that allows superfluous steam to \n",
      "blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit. \n",
      "He did not see and did not hear how they shot the \n",
      "prisoners who lagged behind, though more than a hundred \n",
      "perished in that way. He di d not think of Karataev who \n",
      "grew weaker every day and evidently would soon have to \n",
      "share that fate. Still less di d Pierre think about himself. \n",
      "The harder his position became and the more terrible the \n",
      "future, the more independent of  that position in which he \n",
      "found himself were the joyf ul and comforting thoughts, \n",
      "memories, and imaginings that came to him. War and Peace  \n",
      "2506 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XIII \n",
      "At midday on the twenty-second of October Pierre was \n",
      "going uphill along the muddy, slippery road, looking at \n",
      "his feet and at the roughness of the way. Occasionally he \n",
      "glanced at the familiar crowd around him and then again \n",
      "at his feet. The former and the latter were alike familiar \n",
      "and his own. The blue-gra y bandy legged dog ran merrily \n",
      "along the side of the road, sometimes in proof of its \n",
      "agility and self-satisfacti on lifting one hind leg and \n",
      "hopping along on three, and then  again going on all four \n",
      "and rushing to bark at the cr ows that sat on  the carrion. \n",
      "The dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in \n",
      "Moscow. All around lay the fles h of different animals- \n",
      "from men to horses- in vari ous stages of decomposition; \n",
      "and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the \n",
      "dog could eat all it wanted. \n",
      "It had been raining since morning and had seemed as if \n",
      "at any moment it might cease and the sky clear, but after a \n",
      "short break it began raining harder than before. The \n",
      "saturated road no longer abso rbed the water, which ran \n",
      "along the ruts in streams. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2507 of 2882 \n",
      "Pierre walked along, looki ng from side to side, \n",
      "counting his steps in threes, and reckoning them off on his \n",
      "fingers. Mentally addressing th e rain, he repeated: ‘Now \n",
      "then, now then, go on! Pelt harder!’ \n",
      "It seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing, but \n",
      "far down and deep within him his soul was occupied with \n",
      "something important and comforting. This something was \n",
      "a most subtle spiritual deduction from a conversation with \n",
      "Karataev the day before. \n",
      "At their yesterday’s halting place, feeling chilly by a \n",
      "dying campfire, Pierre had got  up and gone to the next \n",
      "one, which was burning better. There Platon Karataev was \n",
      "sitting covered up- head and all-  with his greatcoat as if it \n",
      "were a vestment, telling the soldiers in his effective and \n",
      "pleasant though now feeble voice a story Pierre knew. It \n",
      "was already past midnight, the hour when Karataev was \n",
      "usually free of his fever a nd particularly lively. When \n",
      "Pierre reached the fire and heard Platon’s voice enfeebled \n",
      "by illness, and saw his pathetic face brightly lit up by the \n",
      "blaze, he felt a painful prick at his heart. His feeling of \n",
      "pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go \n",
      "away, but there was no othe r fire, and Pierre sat down, \n",
      "trying not to look at Platon. \n",
      "‘Well, how are you?’ he asked. War and Peace  \n",
      "2508 of 2882 \n",
      "‘How am I? If we grumbl e at sickness, God won’t \n",
      "grant us death,’ replied Pl aton, and at once resumed the \n",
      "story he had begun. \n",
      "‘And so, brother,’ he continued, with a smile on his \n",
      "pale emaciated face and a particularly happy light in his \n",
      "eyes, ‘ you see, brother..’ \n",
      "Pierre had long been familiar with that story. Karataev \n",
      "had told it to him alone some half-dozen times and always \n",
      "with a specially joyful emo tion. But well as he knew it, \n",
      "Pierre now listened to that tale as to something new, and \n",
      "the quiet rapture Karataev evidently felt as he told it \n",
      "communicated itself also to Pierre. The story was of an \n",
      "old merchant who lived a good and God-fearing life with \n",
      "his family, and who went once to the Nizhni fair with a \n",
      "companion- a rich merchant. \n",
      "Having put up at an inn they  both went to sleep, and \n",
      "next morning his companion was found robbed and with \n",
      "his throat cut. A bloodstained knife was found under the \n",
      "old merchant’s pillow. He  was tried, knouted, and his \n",
      "nostrils having been torn off, ‘all in due form’ as Karataev \n",
      "put it, he was sent to hard labor in Siberia. \n",
      "‘And so, brother’ (it was at this point that Pierre came \n",
      "up), ‘ten years or more passed by. The old man was living \n",
      "as a convict, submitting as he should and doing no wrong. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2509 of 2882 \n",
      "Only he prayed to God for death. Well, one night the \n",
      "convicts were gathered just as we are, with the old man \n",
      "among them. And they began telling what each was \n",
      "suffering for, and how they had sinned against God. One \n",
      "told how he had taken a life, another had taken two, a \n",
      "third had set a house on fire, while another had simply \n",
      "been a vagrant and had done nothing. So they asked the \n",
      "old man: ‘What are you bei ng punished for, Daddy?’- ‘I, \n",
      "my dear brothers,’ said he , ‘am being punished for my \n",
      "own and other men’s sins. But I have not killed anyone or \n",
      "taken anything that was not mine, but have only helped \n",
      "my poorer brothers. I was a me rchant, my dear brothers, \n",
      "and had much property. ‘And he went on to tell them all \n",
      "about it in due order. ‘I don’t grieve for myself,’ he says, \n",
      "‘God, it seems, has chastened me. Only I am sorry for my \n",
      "old wife and the children,’ and the old man began to \n",
      "weep. Now it happened that in the group was the very \n",
      "man who had killed the other merchant. ‘Where did it \n",
      "happen, Daddy?’ he said. ‘When, and in what month?’ He \n",
      "asked all about it and his he art began to ache. So he \n",
      "comes up to the old man like this, and falls down at his \n",
      "feet! ‘You are perishing because of me, Daddy,’ he says. \n",
      "‘It’s quite true, lads , that this man,’ he says, ‘is being \n",
      "tortured innocently and for nothing! I,’ he says, ‘did that War and Peace  \n",
      "2510 of 2882 \n",
      "deed, and I put the knife under your head while you were \n",
      "asleep. Forgive me, Daddy,’ he says, ‘for Christ’s sake!’’ \n",
      "Karataev paused, smiling joyously as he gazed into the \n",
      "fire, and he drew the logs together. \n",
      "‘And the old man said, ‘God will forgive you, we are \n",
      "all sinners in His sight. I suffe r for my own sins,’ and he \n",
      "wept bitter tears. Well, and what do you think, dear \n",
      "friends?’ Karataev continued, his face brightening more \n",
      "and more with a rapturous smile  as if what he now had to \n",
      "tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of \n",
      "his story: ‘What do you thi nk, dear fellows? That \n",
      "murderer confessed to the au thorities. ‘I have taken six \n",
      "lives,’ he says (he was a great sinner), ‘but what I am \n",
      "most sorry for is this old man. Don’t let him suffer \n",
      "because of me.’ So he conf essed and it was all written \n",
      "down and the papers sent off in due form. The place was a \n",
      "long way off, and while they were judging, what with one \n",
      "thing and another, filling in the papers all in due form- the \n",
      "authorities I mean- time passed. The affair reached the \n",
      "Tsar. After a while the Tsar’s decree came: to set the \n",
      "merchant free and give him a compensation that had been \n",
      "awarded. The paper arrived and they began to look for the \n",
      "old man. ‘Where is the old man who has been suffering \n",
      "innocently and in vain? A paper has come from the Tsar!’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2511 of 2882 \n",
      "so they began looking for him,’ here Karataev’s lower jaw \n",
      "trembled, ‘but God had alr eady forgiven him- he was \n",
      "dead! That’s how it was, dear fellows!’ Karataev \n",
      "concluded and sat for a long time silent, gazing before \n",
      "him with a smile. \n",
      "And Pierre’s soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by \n",
      "the story itself but by its my sterious significance: by the \n",
      "rapturous joy that lit up Karataev’s face as he told it, and \n",
      "the mystic significance of that joy. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2512 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XIV \n",
      "‘A vos places!’* suddenly cried a voice. \n",
      "*\"To your places.’ \n",
      "A pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of \n",
      "something joyful and solemn was aroused among the \n",
      "soldiers of the convoy and th e prisoners. From all sides \n",
      "came shouts of command, and fr om the left came smartly \n",
      "dressed cavalrymen on good horse s, passing the prisoners \n",
      "at a trot. The expression on all faces showed the tension \n",
      "people feel at the approach of those in authority. The \n",
      "prisoners thronged together and were pushed off the road. \n",
      "The convoy formed up. \n",
      "‘The Emperor! The Emperor! The Marshal! The \n",
      "Duke!’ and hardly had the sleek  cavalry passed, before a \n",
      "carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled by. Pierre caught \n",
      "a glimpse of a man in a three- cornered hat with a tranquil \n",
      "look on his handsome, plump, white face. It was one of \n",
      "the marshals. His eye fell on Pierre’s large and striking \n",
      "figure, and in the expression with which he frowned and \n",
      "looked away Pierre thought he detected sympathy and a \n",
      "desire to conceal that sympathy. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2513 of 2882 \n",
      "The general in charge of th e stores galloped after the \n",
      "carriage with a red and fri ghtened face, whipping up his \n",
      "skinny horse. Several officers formed a group and some \n",
      "soldiers crowded round th em. Their faces all looked \n",
      "excited and worried. \n",
      "‘What did he say? What did he say?’ Pierre heard them \n",
      "ask. \n",
      "While the marshal was passing, the prisoners had \n",
      "huddled together in a crowd, and Pierre saw Karataev \n",
      "whom he had not yet seen th at morning. He sat in his \n",
      "short overcoat leaning against a birch tree. On his face, \n",
      "besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday \n",
      "while telling the tale of the merchant who suffered \n",
      "innocently, there was now an expression of quiet \n",
      "solemnity. \n",
      "Karataev looked at Pierre with his kindl y round eyes \n",
      "now filled with tears, evidentl y wishing him to come near \n",
      "that he might say something to him. But Pierre was not \n",
      "sufficiently sure of himself. He made as if he did not \n",
      "notice that look and moved hastily away. \n",
      "When the prisoners again we nt forward Pierre looked \n",
      "round. Karataev was still sitting at the side of the road \n",
      "under the birch tree and two Frenchmen were talking over War and Peace  \n",
      "2514 of 2882 \n",
      "his head. Pierre did not look round again but went limping \n",
      "up the hill. \n",
      "From behind, where Karataev had been sitting, came \n",
      "the sound of a shot. Pierre heard it plainly, but at that \n",
      "moment he remembered that he had not yet finished \n",
      "reckoning up how many stages still remained to \n",
      "Smolensk- a calculation he had begun before the marshal \n",
      "went by. And he again started reckoning. Two French \n",
      "soldiers ran past Pierre, one of whom carried a lowered \n",
      "and smoking gun. They both looked pale, and in the \n",
      "expression on their faces- one of them glanced timidly at \n",
      "Pierre- there was something resembling what he had seen \n",
      "on the face of the young soldier at the execution. Pierre \n",
      "looked at the soldier and remembered that, two days \n",
      "before, that man had burned his shirt while drying it at the \n",
      "fire and how they had laughed at him. \n",
      "Behind him, where Karataev had been sitting, the dog \n",
      "began to howl. ‘What a stupid beast! Why is it howling?’ \n",
      "thought Pierre. \n",
      "His comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking beside \n",
      "him, avoided looking back at the place where the shot had \n",
      "been fired and the dog was howling, just as Pierre did, but \n",
      "there was a set look on all their faces. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2515 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XV \n",
      "The stores, the prisoners, and the marshal’s baggage \n",
      "train stopped at the village of Shamshevo. The men \n",
      "crowded together round the ca mpfires. Pierre went up to \n",
      "the fire, ate some roast horseflesh, lay down with his back \n",
      "to the fire, and immediately fe ll asleep. He again slept as \n",
      "he had done at Mozhaysk after the battle of Borodino. \n",
      "Again real events mingled with dreams and again \n",
      "someone, he or another, gave expression to his thoughts, \n",
      "and even to the same thoughts that had been expressed in \n",
      "his dream at Mozhaysk. \n",
      "‘Life is everything. Life is God. Everything changes \n",
      "and moves and that movement is God. And while there is \n",
      "life there is joy in consciousne ss of the divine. To love \n",
      "life is to love God. Harder a nd more blessed than all else \n",
      "is to love this life in one’s sufferings, in innocent \n",
      "sufferings.’ \n",
      "‘Karataev!’ came to Pierre’s mind. \n",
      "And suddenly he saw vividly before him a long-\n",
      "forgotten, kindly old man w ho had given him geography \n",
      "lessons in Switzerland. ‘Wait a bit,’ said the old man, and \n",
      "showed Pierre a globe. This globe was alive- a vibrating War and Peace  \n",
      "2516 of 2882 \n",
      "ball without fixed dimensions. Its whole surface consisted \n",
      "of drops closely pressed t ogether, and all these drops \n",
      "moved and changed places, sometimes several of them \n",
      "merging into one, sometimes one dividing into many. \n",
      "Each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space \n",
      "as possible, but others striving to do the same compressed \n",
      "it, sometimes destroyed it, and sometimes merged with it. \n",
      "‘That is life,’ said the old teacher. \n",
      "‘How simple and clear it is,’ thought Pierre. ‘How is it \n",
      "I did not know it before?’ \n",
      "‘God is in the midst, and each drop tries to expand so \n",
      "as to reflect Him to the greatest extent. And it grows, \n",
      "merges, disappears from the surface, sinks to the depths, \n",
      "and again emerges. There now , Karataev has spread out \n",
      "and disappeared. Do you understa nd, my child?’ said the \n",
      "teacher. \n",
      "‘Do you understand, damn you?’ shouted a voice, and \n",
      "Pierre woke up. \n",
      "He lifted himself and sat up. A Frenchman who had \n",
      "just pushed a Russian soldier away was squatting by the \n",
      "fire, engaged in roasting a piece of meat stuck on a \n",
      "ramrod. His sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy, hairy, \n",
      "red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2517 of 2882 \n",
      "ramrod. His brown morose face with frowning brows was \n",
      "clearly visible by the glow of the charcoal. \n",
      "‘It’s all the same to him,’ he muttered, turning quickly \n",
      "to a soldier who stood behind him. ‘Brigand! Get away!’ \n",
      "And twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at Pierre, \n",
      "who turned away and gazed into the darkness. A prisoner, \n",
      "the Russian soldier the Frenchman had pushed away, was \n",
      "sitting near the fire patting something with his hand. \n",
      "Looking more closely Pierre  recognized the blue-gray \n",
      "dog, sitting beside the soldier, wagging its tail. \n",
      "‘Ah, he’s come?’ said Pierre. ‘And Plat-’ he began, but \n",
      "did not finish. \n",
      "Suddenly and simultaneously  a crowd of memories \n",
      "awoke in his fancy- of the look Platon had given him as \n",
      "he sat under the tree, of the shot heard from that spot, of \n",
      "the dog’s howl, of the guilty faces of the two Frenchmen \n",
      "as they ran past him, of the lowered and smoking gun, and \n",
      "of Karataev’s absence at this halt- and he was on the point \n",
      "of realizing that Karataev had been killed, but just at that \n",
      "instant, he knew not why, th e recollection came to his \n",
      "mind of a summer evening he had spent with a beautiful \n",
      "Polish lady on the veranda of his house in Kiev. And \n",
      "without linking up the events of the day or drawing a \n",
      "conclusion from them, Pierre closed his eyes, seeing a War and Peace  \n",
      "2518 of 2882 \n",
      "vision of the country in summertime mingled with \n",
      "memories of bathing and of the liquid, vibrating globe, \n",
      "and he sank into water so that it closed over his head. \n",
      "Before sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud \n",
      "and rapid firing. French soldiers were running past him. \n",
      "‘The Cossacks!’ one of them shouted, and a moment \n",
      "later a crowd of Russians surrounded Pierre. \n",
      "For a long time he could not understand what was \n",
      "happening to him. All around he heard his comrades \n",
      "sobbing with joy. \n",
      "‘Brothers! Dear fellows! Darlings!’ old soldiers \n",
      "exclaimed, weeping, as they embraced Cossacks and \n",
      "hussars. \n",
      "The hussars and Cossacks crowded round the \n",
      "prisoners; one offered them cl othes, another boots, and a \n",
      "third bread. Pierre sobbed as he sat among them and could \n",
      "not utter a word. He hugged the first soldier who \n",
      "approached him, and kissed him, weeping. \n",
      "Dolokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house, letting \n",
      "a crowd of disarmed Frenchmen pass by. The French, \n",
      "excited by all that had happened, were talking loudly \n",
      "among themselves, but as they passed Dolokhov who \n",
      "gently switched his boots with his whip and watched them \n",
      "with cold glassy eyes that boded no good, they became \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",

      "raised his companion and said  something, pointing to his \n",

      "The sole importance of the crossing of the Berezina \n",
      "lies in the fact that it pl ainly and indubitably proved the \n",

      "2597 of 2882 \n",
      "fallacy of all the plans for cutting off the enemy’s retreat \n",

      "namely, simply to follow the enemy up. The French \n",
      "crowd fled at a continually increasing speed and all its \n",

      "wounded animal and it was impossible to block its path. \n",

      "now rainy and now snowy, internal physical distress, and \n",

      "house at Yaroslavl, and Denis ov who told him this news \n",
      "also mentioned Helene’s death, supposing that Pierre had \n",
      "heard of it long before. All this  at the time seemed merely \n",
      "strange to Pierre: he fe lt he could not grasp its \n",

      "quickly as possible from places where people were killing \n",
      "one another, to some peaceful refuge where he could \n",
      "recover himself, rest, and th ink over all the strange new \n",

      "Vaska, who had come from Moscow; and also his cousin \n",
      "the eldest princess, who had been living on his estate at \n",

      "would be sure to get his dinne r, tea, and supper. But for a \n",

      "freedom natural to man which he had first experienced at \n",

      "freedom, which was independent of external conditions, \n",
      "now had as it were an additional setting of external \n",
      "liberty. He was alone in a strange town, without \n",

      "must exist somewhere and had looked for it. In everything \n",
      "near and comprehensible he had only what was limited, \n",
      "petty, commonplace, and senseless. He had equipped \n",

      "seemed to him. But even then, at moments of weakness as \n",
      "he had accounted them, his mind had penetrated to those \n",

      "2619 of 2882 \n",

      "This officer began visiting Pierre, and the princess \n",
      "used to make fun of the tenderness the Italian expressed \n",

      "‘If all Russians are in the l east like you, it is sacrilege \n",

      "Pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the \n",

      "2620 of 2882 \n",
      "introduced him to the lodge in 1807, came to see him. \n",
      "Willarski was married to a Russian heiress who had a \n",
      "large estate in Orel province, and he occupied a temporary \n",
      "post in the commissariat department in that town. \n",
      "Hearing that Bezukhov was in Orel, Willarski, though \n",

      "Willarski was a married man with a family, busy with \n",
      "his family affairs, his wife’s affairs, and his official \n",
      "duties. He regarded all these occupations as hindrances to \n",
      "life, and considered that th ey were all contemptible \n",
      "because their aim was the welfare of himself and his \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2621 of 2882 \n",
      "family. Military, administra tive, political, and Masonic \n",

      "without trying to change the other’s views and without \n",
      "condemning him, but with the quiet, joyful, and amused \n",
      "smile now habitual to him, was interested in this strange \n",
      "though very familiar phenomenon. \n",
      "There was a new feature in Pierre’s relations with \n",
      "Willarski, with the princess, with the doctor, and with all \n",
      "the people he now met, which gained for him the general \n",
      "good will. This was his acknowledgment of the \n",
      "impossibility of changing a man’s convictions by words, \n",
      "and his recognition of the possibility of everyone \n",
      "thinking, feeling, and seeing things each from his own \n",
      "point of view. This legi timate peculiarity of each \n",
      "individual which used to exci te and irritate Pierre now \n",
      "became a basis of the sympathy he felt for, and the \n",

      "sometimes complete contradiction, between men’s \n",

      "Formerly all pecuniary questi ons, especially requests for War and Peace  \n",
      "2622 of 2882 \n",
      "money to which, as an extremely wealthy man, he was \n",
      "very exposed, produced in him a state of hopeless \n",
      "agitation and perplexity . ‘To give or not to give?’ he had \n",
      "asked himself. ‘I have it and he needs it. But someone \n",
      "else needs it still more. W ho needs it most? And perhaps \n",
      "they are both impostors?’ In the old days he had been \n",
      "unable to find a way out of all these surmises and had \n",
      "given to all who asked as long as he had anything to give. \n",
      "Formerly he had been in a similar state of perplexity with \n",

      "one person advised one thing and another something else. \n",
      "Now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt \n",

      "to him decided what should or should not be done. \n",
      "He was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters, \n",
      "but now he felt certain of what ought and what ought not \n",
      "to be done. The first time he  had recourse to his new \n",
      "judge was when a French prisoner, a colonel, came to him \n",
      "and, after talking a great deal about his exploits, \n",
      "concluded by making what amounted to a demand that \n",
      "Pierre should give him four t housand francs to send to his \n",
      "wife and children. Pierre refused without the least \n",
      "difficulty or effort, and wa s afterwards surprised how \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2623 of 2882 \n",
      "simple and easy had been what used to appear so \n",
      "insurmountably difficult. At the same time that he refused \n",
      "the colonel’s demand he made  up his mind that he must \n",
      "have recourse to artifice when leaving Orel, to induce the \n",
      "Italian officer to accept some  money of which he was \n",
      "evidently in need. A further proof to Pierre of his own \n",
      "more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished \n",
      "by his decision with regard to his wife’s debts and to the \n",
      "rebuilding of his houses in and near Moscow. \n",
      "His head steward came to him at Orel and Pierre \n",
      "reckoned up with him his diminished income. The \n",
      "burning of Moscow had cost him, according to the head \n",
      "steward’s calculation, about two million rubles. \n",
      "To console Pierre for these losses the head steward \n",
      "gave him an estimate showing that despite these losses his \n",
      "income would not be diminished but would even be \n",
      "increased if he refused to pa y his wife’s debts which he \n",
      "was under no obligation to meet, and did not rebuild his \n",
      "Moscow house and the country house on his Moscow \n",
      "estate, which had cost him eighty thousand rubles a year \n",
      "and brought in nothing. \n",
      "‘Yes, of course that’s true,’ said Pierre with a cheerful \n",
      "smile. ‘I don’t need all that at all. By being ruined I have \n",
      "become much richer.’ War and Peace  \n",
      "2624 of 2882 \n",

      "the estimate an architect had made of the cost of \n",
      "rebuilding the town and country houses, speaking of this \n",
      "as of a settled matter. About the same time he received \n",
      "letters from Prince Vas ili and other Petersburg \n",
      "acquaintances speaking of his wife’s debts. And Pierre \n",
      "decided that the steward’s proposals which had so pleased \n",
      "him were wrong and that he must go to Petersburg and \n",
      "settle his wife’s affairs and must rebuild in Moscow. Why \n",
      "this was necessary he did not know, but he knew for \n",
      "certain that it was necessary. His income would be \n",
      "reduced by three fourths, but he felt it must be done. \n",

      "intensified. Throughout hi s journey he felt like a \n",
      "schoolboy on holiday. Everyone - the stagecoach driver, \n",
      "the post-house overseers, the pe asants on the roads and in \n",
      "the villages- had a new significance for him. The presence \n",
      "and remarks of Willarski who continually deplored the \n",

      "Moscow after it had been cleared of the enemy were most \n",
      "diverse and personal, and at fi rst for the most part savage \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2627 of 2882 \n",
      "desire to get to the place that had been called Moscow, to \n",

      "The first Russians to enter Moscow were the Cossacks \n",

      "Moscow and had been hiding in  its vicinity. The Russians \n",
      "who entered Moscow, finding it plundered, plundered it in \n",
      "their turn. They continued what the French had begun. \n",
      "Trains of peasant carts came to Moscow to carry off to the \n",
      "villages what had been abandoned in the ruined houses \n",
      "and the streets. The Cossacks carried off what they could \n",
      "to their camps, and the househol ders seized all they could \n",

      "governmental and religious institutions. These forms were \n",
      "lifeless but still existed. There were bazaars, shops, \n",
      "warehouses, market stalls, granaries- for the most part still \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2632 of 2882 \n",
      "from that feeling which, it seemed to him, he had aroused \n",
      "in himself. \n",
      "On the third day after his arrival he heard from the \n",
      "Drubetskoys that Princess Ma ry was in Moscow. The \n",

      "that they had both lived and bot h died and in the love he \n",

      "spoke of you even at the very last,’ she went on, turning War and Peace  \n",
      "2634 of 2882 \n",
      "her eyes from Pierre to her companion with a shyness that \n",
      "surprised him for an instant. \n",
      "‘I was so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first \n",
      "piece of good news we had received for a long time.’ \n",
      "Again the princess glanced round at her companion \n",
      "with even more uneasiness in her manner and was about \n",
      "to add something, but Pierre interrupted her. \n",
      "‘Just imagine- I knew nothing about him!’ said he. ‘I \n",
      "thought he had been killed. All I know I heard at second \n",
      "hand from others. I only know that he fell in with the \n",
      "Rostovs.... What a strange coincidence!’ \n",
      "Pierre spoke rapidly and w ith animation. He glanced \n",
      "once at the companion’s face, saw her attentive and \n",
      "kindly gaze fixed on him, and, as often happens when one \n",
      "is talking, felt somehow that this companion in the black \n",
      "dress was a good, kind, excellent  creature who would not \n",
      "hinder his conversing freely with Princess Mary. \n",
      "But when he mentioned the Rostovs, Princess Mary’s \n",
      "face expressed still greater embarrassment. She again \n",
      "glanced rapidly from Pierre’s face to that of the lady in \n",
      "the black dress and said: \n",
      "‘Do you really not recognize her?’ \n",
      "Pierre looked again at the companion’s pale, delicate \n",
      "face with its black eyes and peculiar mouth, and \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2635 of 2882 \n",
      "something near to him, l ong forgotten and more than \n",
      "sweet, looked at him from those attentive eyes. \n",
      "‘But no, it can’t be!’ he thought. ‘This stern, thin, pale \n",
      "face that looks so much older! It cannot be she. It merely \n",
      "reminds me of her.’ But at that moment Princess Mary \n",
      "said, ‘Natasha!’ And with di fficulty, effort, and stress, \n",
      "like the opening of a door gr own rusty on its hinges, a \n",
      "smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes, and \n",
      "from that opening door came a breath of fragrance which \n",
      "suffused Pierre with a happine ss he had long forgotten \n",
      "and of which he had not even been thinking- especially at \n",
      "that moment. It suffused him, seized him, and enveloped \n",
      "him completely. When sh e smiled doubt was no longer \n",
      "possible, it was Natasha and he loved her. \n",
      "At that moment Pierre involunt arily betrayed to her, to \n",
      "Princess Mary, and above all to himself, a secret of which \n",
      "he himself had been unaware. He flushed joyfully yet \n",
      "with painful distress. He trie d to hide his agitation. But \n",
      "the more he tried to hide it the more clearly- clearer than \n",
      "any words could have done- did he betray to himself, to \n",
      "her, and to Princess Mary that he loved her. \n",
      "‘No, it’s only the unexpectedness of it,’ thought Pierre. \n",
      "But as soon as he tried to continue the conversation he \n",
      "had begun with Princess Mary he again glanced at War and Peace  \n",
      "2636 of 2882 \n",
      "Natasha, and a still-deeper flush suffused his face and a \n",
      "still-stronger agitation of mingl ed joy and fear seized his \n",
      "soul. He became confused in his speech and stopped in \n",
      "the middle of what he was saying. \n",
      "Pierre had failed to notice Natasha because he did not \n",
      "at all expect to see her th ere, but he had failed to \n",
      "recognize her because the change in her since he last saw \n",
      "her was immense. She had grown thin and pale, but that \n",
      "was not what made her unrecognizable; she was \n",
      "unrecognizable at the moment he entered because on that \n",
      "face whose eyes had always shone with a suppressed \n",
      "smile of the joy of life, now when he first entered and \n",
      "glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile: \n",
      "only her eyes were kindl y attentive and sadly \n",
      "interrogative. \n",
      "Pierre’s confusion was not reflected by any confusion \n",
      "on Natasha’s part, but only by the pleasure that just \n",
      "perceptibly lit up her whole face. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2637 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XVI \n",
      "‘She has come to stay with me,’ said Princess Mary. \n",
      "‘The count and countess will be here in a few days. The \n",
      "countess is in a dreadful stat e; but it was necessary for \n",
      "Natasha herself to see a doctor. They insisted on her \n",
      "coming with me.’ \n",
      "‘Yes, is there a family free from sorrow now?’ said \n",
      "Pierre, addressing Natasha. ‘You know it happened the \n",
      "very day we were rescued. I saw him. What a delightful \n",
      "boy he was!’ \n",
      "Natasha looked at him, and by way of answer to his \n",
      "words her eyes widened and lit up. \n",
      "‘What can one say or think of  as a consolation?’ said \n",
      "Pierre. ‘Nothing! Why had such a splendid boy, so full of \n",
      "life, to die?’ \n",
      "‘Yes, in these days it woul d be hard to live without \n",

      "2638 of 2882 \n",
      "‘How can you ask why?’ said Princess Mary. ‘The \n",
      "thought alone of what awaits..’ \n",
      "Natasha without waiting for Princess Mary to finish \n",
      "again looked inquiringly at Pierre. \n",
      "‘And because,’ Pierre continued, ‘only one who \n",
      "believes that there is a God ruling us can bear a loss such \n",
      "as hers and... yours.’ \n",
      "Natasha had already opened her mouth to speak but \n",
      "suddenly stopped. Pierre hurriedly turned away from her \n",
      "and again addressed Princes s Mary, asking about his \n",
      "friend’s last days. \n",
      "Pierre’s confusion had now almost vanished, but at the \n",
      "same time he felt that his freedom had also completely \n",
      "gone. He felt that there was now a judge of his every \n",
      "word and action whose judgment mattered more to him \n",
      "than that of all the rest of the world. As he spoke now he \n",
      "was considering what impre ssion his words would make \n",
      "on Natasha. He did not purposely say things to please her, \n",
      "but whatever he was saying he regarded from her \n",
      "standpoint. \n",
      "Princess Mary- reluctantly as is usual in such cases- \n",
      "began telling of the conditi on in which she had found \n",

      "his questions and his eager re stless expression, gradually \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2639 of 2882 \n",
      "compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall \n",
      "for her own sake. \n",
      "‘Yes, yes, and so...? ‘ Pierre kept saying as he leaned \n",
      "toward her with his whole body and eagerly listened to \n",
      "her story. ‘Yes, yes... so he grew tranquil and softened? \n",
      "With all his soul he had always sought one thing- to be \n",
      "perfectly good- so he could not be afraid of death. The \n",
      "faults he had- if he had a ny- were not of his making. So \n",
      "he did soften?... What a happy thing that he saw you \n",
      "again,’ he added, suddenly turning to Natasha and looking \n",
      "at her with eyes full of tears. \n",
      "Natasha’s face twitched. She frowned and lowered her \n",
      "eyes for a moment. She hesitated for an instant whether to \n",
      "speak or not. \n",
      "‘Yes, that was happiness,’ she then said in her quiet \n",
      "voice with its deep chest notes. ‘For me it certainly was \n",
      "happiness.’ She paused. ‘And he ... he... he said he was \n",
      "wishing for it at the very moment I entered the room...’ \n",
      "Natasha’s voice broke. Sh e blushed, pressed her \n",
      "clasped hands on her knees, a nd then controlling herself \n",
      "with an evident effort lifted her head and began to speak \n",
      "rapidly. \n",
      "‘We knew nothing of it when we started from \n",

      "2640 of 2882 \n",
      "Sonya told me he was traveling with us. I had no idea and \n",
      "could not imagine what state he was in, all I wanted was \n",
      "to see him and be with hi m,’ she said, trembling, and \n",
      "breathing quickly. \n",
      "And not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell \n",
      "what she had never yet men tioned to anyone- all she had \n",
      "lived through during those th ree weeks of their journey \n",
      "and life at Yaroslavl. \n",
      "Pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed \n",
      "upon her full of tears. As he listened he did not think of \n",
      "Prince Andrew, nor of death, no r of what she was telling. \n",
      "He listened to her and felt only pity for her, for what she \n",
      "was suffering now while she was speaking. \n",
      "Princess Mary, frowning in he r effort to hold back her \n",
      "tears, sat beside Natasha, and heard for the first time the \n",
      "story of those last days of  her brother’s and Natasha’s \n",
      "love. \n",
      "Evidently Natasha needed to te ll that painful yet joyful \n",

      "She spoke, mingling most tr ifling details with the \n",
      "intimate secrets of her soul, and it seemed as if she could \n",
      "never finish. Several times she repeated the same thing \n",
      "twice. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2641 of 2882 \n",
      "Dessalles’ voice was heard outside the door asking \n",
      "whether little Nicholas might come in to say good night. \n",
      "‘Well, that’s all- everything,’ said Natasha. \n",
      "She got up quickly just as Ni cholas entered, almost ran \n",
      "to the door which was hidden by curtains, struck her head \n",
      "against it, and rushed from the room with a moan either of \n",
      "pain or sorrow. \n",
      "Pierre gazed at the door through which she had \n",
      "disappeared and did not understa nd why he suddenly felt \n",
      "all alone in the world. \n",
      "Princess Mary roused him from his abstraction by \n",

      "At that moment of emotional tenderness young \n",
      "Nicholas’ face, which resembled his father’s, affected \n",
      "Pierre so much that when he  had kissed the boy he got up \n",
      "quickly, took out his handkerc hief, and went to the \n",

      "Chapter XVII \n",
      "Pierre was shown into the la rge, brightly lit dining \n",

      "They all three of them now experienced that feeling of \n",
      "awkwardness which usually follows after a serious and \n",

      "conversation, to talk of trifles is awkward, and yet the \n",
      "desire to speak is there and silence seems like affectation. \n",
      "They went silently to table.  The footmen drew back the \n",
      "chairs and pushed them up again. Pierre unfolded his cold \n",
      "table napkin and, resolving to break the silence, looked at \n",
      "Natasha and at Princess Mary. They had evidently both \n",
      "formed the same resolution; the eyes of both shone with \n",
      "satisfaction and a confession th at besides sorrow life also \n",

      "‘Do you take vodka, Count?’ asked Princess Mary, and \n",

      "2643 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Yes,’ replied Pierre with the smile of mild irony now \n",
      "habitual to him. ‘They even tell me wonders I myself \n",
      "never dreamed of! Mary Abramovna invited me to her \n",
      "house and kept telling me what had happened, or ought to \n",
      "have happened, to me. Stepan Stepanych also instructed \n",
      "me how I ought to tell of my experiences. In general I \n",
      "have noticed that it is very easy to be an interesting man (I \n",

      "‘that you lost two millions in Moscow. Is that true?’ \n",
      "‘But I am three times as rich as before,’ returned \n",

      "pay his wife’s debts and to rebuild his houses, Pierre still \n",
      "maintained that he had become three times as rich as \n",
      "before. \n",
      "‘What I have certainly gained is freedom,’ he began \n",
      "seriously, but did not continue , noticing that this theme \n",

      "‘No,’ answered Pierre, evidently not considering \n",
      "awkward the meaning Princess Mary had given to his \n",
      "words. ‘I heard of it in Orel and you cannot imagine how \n",
      "it shocked me. We were not an exemplary couple,’ he \n",
      "added quickly, glancing at Natasha and noticing on her \n",
      "face curiosity as to how he would speak of his wife, ‘but \n",
      "her death shocked me terribly. When two people quarrel \n",

      "‘Yes, and so you are once more an eligible bachelor,’ \n",
      "said Princess Mary. \n",
      "Pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time \n",

      "2646 of 2882 \n",
      "Princess Mary with a gentle smile looked now at Pierre \n",

      "described. Not only her look, but her exclamations and \n",
      "the brief questions she put, showed Pierre that she \n",
      "understood just what he wish ed to convey. It was clear \n",
      "that she understood not only what he said but also what he \n",
      "wished to, but could not, express in words. The account \n",
      "Pierre gave of the incident with the child and the woman \n",
      "for protecting whom he was arrested was this: ‘It was an \n",
      "awful sight- children abandoned, some in the flames... \n",
      "One was snatched out before my eyes... and there were \n",
      "women who had their things  snatched off and their \n",

      "‘I am sure you’re not telli ng us everything; I am sure \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",

      "Pierre continued. When he spoke of the execution he \n",
      "wanted to pass over the horrible details, but Natasha \n",
      "insisted that he should not omit anything. \n",
      "Pierre began to tell about Karataev, but paused. By this \n",
      "time he had risen from the table and was pacing the room, \n",
      "Natasha following him with her eyes. Then he added: \n",
      "‘No, you can’t understand what I learned from that \n",

      "who wish to adopt it to some thought of their own and \n",
      "promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared \n",

      "real women gifted with a capacity to select and absorb the War and Peace  \n",
      "2648 of 2882 \n",
      "very best a man shows of himself. Natasha without \n",
      "knowing it was all attention: she did not lose a word, no \n",
      "single quiver in Pierre’s voice, no look, no twitch of a \n",
      "muscle in his face, nor a single gesture. She caught the \n",

      "‘Well, good night, Mary!’ said Natasha. ‘Do you \n",

      "Princess Mary sighed deeply and thereby \n",

      "not express agreement in words. \n",
      "‘Is it possible to forget?’ said she. \n",
      "‘It did me so much good to tell all about it today. It \n",

      "‘I am sure he really loved him.  That is why I told him... \n",
      "Was it all right?’ she added, suddenly blushing. \n",
      "‘To tell Pierre? Oh, yes. Wh at a splendid man he is!’ \n",
      "said Princess Mary. \n",
      "‘Do you know, Mary...’ Natasha suddenly said with a \n",

      "smooth, and fresh- as if he had just come out of a Russian \n",

      "‘Yes,’ replied Princess Mary. ‘He has greatly \n",

      "‘Yes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are \n",
      "friends when they are quite different. That must be true. \n",
      "Really he is quite unlike him- in everything.’ \n",
      "‘Yes, but he’s wonderful.’ \n",

      "It was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that \n",
      "night. He paced up and down his room, now turning his \n",
      "thoughts on a difficult problem and frowning, now \n",
      "suddenly shrugging his shoulde rs and wincing, and now \n",
      "smiling happily. \n",
      "He was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Natasha, and of \n",
      "their love, at one moment jealous of her past, then \n",
      "reproaching himself for that f eeling. It was already six in \n",
      "the morning and he still paced up and down the room. \n",
      "‘Well, what’s to be done if it cannot be avoided? \n",
      "What’s to be done? Evidently it has to be so,’ said he to \n",
      "himself, and hastily undressing he got into bed, happy and \n",
      "agitated but free from hesitation or indecision. \n",
      "‘Strange and impossible as such happiness seems, I \n",
      "must do everything that she a nd I may be man and wife,’ \n",
      "he told himself. \n",
      "A few days previously Pierre had decided to go to \n",
      "Petersburg on the Friday. When he awoke on the \n",
      "Thursday, Savelich came to ask him about packing for the \n",
      "journey. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2653 of 2882 \n",
      "‘What, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? Who is \n",
      "there in Petersburg?’ he as ked involuntarily, though only \n",
      "to himself. ‘Oh, yes, long ago before this happened I did \n",
      "for some reason mean to go to Petersburg,’ he reflected. \n",
      "‘Why? But perhaps I shall go. What a good fellow he is \n",
      "and how attentive, and how he remembers everything,’ he \n",
      "thought, looking at Savelich’s old face, ‘and what a \n",
      "pleasant smile he has!’ \n",
      "‘Well, Savelich, do you still not wish to accept your \n",
      "freedom?’ Pierre asked him. \n",
      "‘What’s the good of freedom to me, your excellency? \n",
      "We lived under the late count- the kingdom of heaven be \n",
      "his!- and we have lived under you too, without ever being \n",
      "wronged.’ \n",
      "‘And your children?’ \n",
      "‘The children will live just the same. With such \n",
      "masters one can live.’ \n",
      "‘But what about my heirs? ’ said Pierre. ‘Supposing I \n",
      "suddenly marry... it might happen,’ he added with an \n",
      "involuntary smile. \n",
      "‘If I may take the liberty, your  excellency, it would be \n",
      "a good thing.’ War and Peace  \n",
      "2654 of 2882 \n",
      "‘How easy he thinks it,’ thought Pierre. ‘He doesn’t \n",
      "know how terrible it is and how dangerous. Too soon or \n",
      "too late... it is terrible!’ \n",
      "‘So what are your orders? Are you starting tomorrow?’ \n",
      "asked Savelich. \n",
      "‘No, I’ll put it off for a bit. I’ll tell you later. You must \n",
      "forgive the trouble I have put you to,’ said Pierre, and \n",
      "seeing Savelich smile, he thought: ‘But how strange it is \n",
      "that he should not know that now there is no  Petersburg \n",
      "for me, and that that must be settled first of all! But \n",
      "probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending. \n",
      "Shall I have a talk with him and see what he thinks?’ \n",
      "Pierre reflected. ‘No, another time.’ \n",
      "At breakfast Pierre told the princess, his cousin, that he \n",

      "there met- ‘Whom do you think? Natasha Rostova!’ \n",
      "The princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary \n",
      "in that than if he had seen Anna Semenovna. \n",
      "‘Do you know her?’ asked Pierre. \n",
      "‘I have seen the princess,’ she replied. ‘I heard that \n",
      "they were arranging a match for her with young Rostov. It \n",
      "would be a very good thing for the Rostovs, they are said \n",
      "to be utterly ruined.’ \n",

      "2655 of 2882 \n",
      "‘I heard about that affair of hers at the time. It was a \n",

      "‘No, she either doesn’t unde rstand or is pretending,’ \n",
      "thought Pierre. ‘Better not say anything to her either.’ \n",
      "The princess too had prepared  provisions for Pierre’s \n",
      "journey. \n",
      "‘How kind they all are,’ thought Pierre. ‘What is \n",
      "surprising is that they shoul d trouble about these things \n",
      "now when it can no longer be of  interest to them. And all \n",
      "for me!’ \n",
      "On the same day the Chief of Police came to Pierre, \n",
      "inviting him to send a representative to the Faceted Palace \n",
      "to recover things that were to  be returned to their owners \n",
      "that day. \n",
      "‘And this man too,’ thought Pierre, looking into the \n",

      "officer and how kind. Fancy bothering about such trifies \n",
      "now! And they actually say he  is not honest and takes \n",
      "bribes. What nonsense! Besides, why shouldn’t he take \n",
      "bribes? That’s the way he was brought up, and everybody \n",
      "does it. But what a kind, pleas ant face and how he smiles \n",
      "as he looks at me.’ \n",
      "Pierre went to Princess Mary’s to dinner. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2656 of 2882 \n",
      "As he drove through the streets past the houses that \n",
      "had been burned down, he was surprised by the beauty of \n",
      "those ruins. The picturesque ness of the chimney stacks \n",
      "and tumble-down walls of th e burned-out quarters of the \n",
      "town, stretching out and concealing one another, \n",
      "reminded him of the Rhine and the Colosseum. The \n",
      "cabmen he met and their passengers, the carpenters \n",
      "cutting the timber for new houses with axes, the women \n",
      "hawkers, and the shopkeeper s, all looked at him with \n",
      "cheerful beaming eyes that seemed to say: ‘Ah, there he \n",

      "At the entrance to Princess Mary’s house Pierre felt \n",
      "doubtful whether he had really been there the night before \n",
      "and really seen Natasha and talked to her. ‘Perhaps I \n",
      "imagined it; perhaps I shall go in and find no one there.’ \n",
      "But he had hardly entered th e room before he felt her \n",
      "presence with his whole bei ng by the loss of his sense of \n",
      "freedom. She was in the same black dress with soft folds \n",
      "and her hair was done the same way as the day before, yet \n",
      "she was quite different. Had sh e been like this when he \n",
      "entered the day before he could not for a moment have \n",
      "failed to recognize her. \n",
      "She was as he had known he r almost as a child and \n",

      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2657 of 2882 \n",
      "light shone in her eyes, and on her face was a friendly and \n",
      "strangely roguish expression. \n",
      "Pierre dined with them and would have spent the \n",
      "whole evening there, but Princess Mary was going to \n",

      "Next day he came early, di ned, and stayed the whole \n",

      "evidently glad to see their visitor and though all \n",
      "Pierre&#x2019;s interest was now centered in that house, \n",
      "by the evening they had talked  over everything and the \n",
      "conversation passed from one tr ivial topic to another and \n",
      "repeatedly broke off. He st ayed so long that Princess \n",

      "wondering when he would go. Pierre noticed this but \n",
      "could not go. He felt uneasy and embarrassed, but sat on \n",
      "because he simply could not get up and take his leave. \n",
      "Princess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and \n",
      "complaining of a headache began to say good night. \n",
      "‘So you are going to Petersburg tomorrow?’ she asked. \n",
      "‘No, I am not going,’ Pierre  replied hastily, in a \n",
      "surprised tone and as t hough offended. ‘Yes... no... to \n",
      "Petersburg? Tomorrow- but I won’t say good-by yet. I \n",
      "will call round in case you have any commissions for me,’ War and Peace  \n",

      "Natasha gave him her hand and went out. Princess \n",
      "Mary on the other hand instead of going away sank into \n",
      "an armchair, and looked sternl y and intently at him with \n",

      "talk. \n",
      "When Natasha left the room Pierre’s confusion and \n",

      "‘Well,’ he went on with an evident effort at self-\n",

      "2659 of 2882 \n",

      "before that she would not only not be hurt if Pierre spoke \n",
      "of his love, but that it was the very thing she wished for. \n",

      "every detail of her face a nd smile, and did not wish to \n",
      "diminish or add anything, but only to repeat it again and \n",

      "A joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought \n",

      "Before analyzing the prope rties of manure, before \n",
      "entering into the debit and credit (as he ironically called \n",

      "not allowing the family groups  to divide into separate \n",

      "Thanks to Denisov the c onversation at table soon \n",

      "they had been happiest toge ther, they suddenly had a War and Peace  \n",
      "2724 of 2882 \n",
      "feeling of estrangement and hostility, which occurred \n",

      "2726 of 2882 \n",
      "and his whole face, as she had so often seen it in the \n",

      "After the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid \n",
      "succession, she felt herself a being accidentally forgotten \n",
      "in this world and left without aim or object for her \n",
      "existence. She ate, drank, slept, or kept awake, but did not \n",
      "live. Life gave her no new impressions. She wanted \n",
      "nothing from life but tranquill ity, and that tranquillity \n",
      "only death could give her. But until death came she had to \n",
      "go on living, that is, to use her vital forces. A peculiarity \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2753 of 2882 \n",
      "one sees in very young childre n and very old people was \n",
      "particularly evident in her. Her life had no external aims- \n",
      "only a need to exercise her various functions and \n",
      "inclinations was apparent. She had to eat, sleep, think, \n",
      "speak, weep, work, give vent to her anger, and so on, \n",
      "merely because she had a stomach, a brain, muscles, \n",
      "nerves, and a liver. She did these things not under any \n",
      "external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do, \n",
      "when behind the purpose for which they strive that of \n",
      "exercising their functions re mains unnoticed. She talked \n",
      "only because she physically needed to exercise her tongue \n",
      "and lungs. She cried as a child does, because her nose had \n",
      "to be cleared, and so on. What for people in their full \n",
      "vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext. \n",
      "Thus in the morning- especially if she had eaten \n",
      "anything rich the day before - she felt a need of being \n",
      "angry and would choose as the handiest pretext Belova’s \n",
      "deafness. \n",
      "She would begin to say something to her in a low tone \n",
      "from the other end of the room. \n",
      "‘It seems a little warmer t oday, my dear,’ she would \n",
      "murmur. War and Peace  \n",
      "2754 of 2882 \n",
      "And when Belova replied: ‘Oh yes, they’ve come,’ she \n",
      "would mutter angrily: ‘O Lord ! How stupid and deaf she \n",
      "is!’ \n",
      "Another pretext would be her snuff, which would seem \n",
      "too dry or too damp or not rubbed fine enough. After \n",
      "these fits of irritability her face would grow yellow, and \n",
      "her maids knew by infallible symptoms when Belova \n",
      "would again be deaf, the s nuff damp, and the countess’ \n",
      "face yellow. Just as she needed to work off her spleen so \n",
      "she had sometimes to exercise her still-existing faculty of \n",
      "thinking- and the pretext for th at was a game of patience. \n",
      "When she needed to cry, the deceased count would be the \n",
      "pretext. When she wanted to be agitated, Nicholas and his \n",
      "health would be the pretext, and when she felt a need to \n",
      "speak spitefully, the pretext would be Countess Mary. \n",
      "When her vocal organs needed exercise, which was \n",
      "usually toward seven o’clock when she had had an after-\n",

      "the government? I don’t understand.’ \n",
      "‘Well, you know, Maman,’ Nicholas interposed, \n",
      "knowing how to translate th ings into his mother’s War and Peace  \n",

      "‘Well, and how is Prince Alexander to blame? He is a \n",
      "most estimable man. I used to meet him at Mary \n",
      "Antonovna’s,’ said the countess in an offended tone; and \n",
      "still more offended that they all remained silent, she went \n",
      "on: ‘Nowadays everyone finds fault. A Gospel Society! \n",
      "Well, and what harm is there in that?’ and she rose \n",
      "(everybody else got up  too) and with a severe expression \n",
      "sailed back to her table in the sitting room. \n",
      "The melancholy silence that followed was broken by \n",

      "happily. \n",

      "‘It means that Anna Makarovna has finished her \n",

      "‘Oh, I’ll go and see,’ said Pierre, jumping up. ‘You \n",
      "know,’ he added, stopping at the door, ‘why I’m \n",
      "especially fond of that music? It is always the first thing \n",
      "that tells me all is well. When I was driving here today, \n",
      "the nearer I got to the house the more anxious I grew. As I \n",
      "entered the anteroom I heard Andrusha’s peals of laughter \n",
      "and that meant that all was well.’ \n",
      "‘I know! I know that feeling, ’ said Nicholas. ‘But I \n",

      "me.’ \n",
      "Pierre went to the chil dren, and the shouting and \n",
      "laughter grew still louder. \n",
      "‘Come, Anna Makarovna,’ Pierre’s voice was heard \n",
      "saying, ‘come here into the middle of the room and at the \n",
      "word of command, ‘One, two,’ and when I say ‘three’... \n",
      "You stand here, and you in my arms- well now! One, \n",
      "two!...’ said Pierre, and a silence followed: ‘three!’ and a \n",
      "rapturously breathless cry of children’s voices filled the \n",
      "room. ‘Two, two!’ they shouted. \n",
      "This meant two stockings, which by a secret process \n",
      "known only to herself Anna Makarovna used to knit at the \n",
      "same time on the same needles, and which, when they War and Peace  \n",
      "2762 of 2882 \n",

      "Soon after this the children came in to say good night. \n",
      "They kissed everyone, the tutors and governesses made \n",
      "their bows, and they went out. Only young Nicholas and \n",
      "his tutor remained. Dessalles  whispered to the boy to \n",
      "come downstairs. \n",
      "‘No, Monsieur Dessalles, I will ask my aunt to let me \n",
      "stay,’ replied Nicholas Bolkonski also in a whisper. \n",
      "‘Ma tante, please let me stay,’ said he, going up to his \n",

      "and I haven’t seen anything of one another yet... How like \n",
      "he is growing, Mary!’ he added, addressing Countess \n",
      "Mary. \n",
      "‘Like my father?’ asked the boy, flushing crimson and \n",
      "looking up at Pierre with bright, ecstatic eyes. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2764 of 2882 \n",
      "Pierre nodded, and went on with what he had been \n",
      "saying when the children had interrupted. Countess Mary \n",
      "sat down doing woolwork; Nata sha did not take her eyes \n",
      "off her husband. Nicholas a nd Denisov rose, asked for \n",
      "their pipes, smoked, went to fetch more tea from Sonya- \n",
      "who sat weary but resolute at the samovar- and \n",
      "questioned Pierre. The curly-headed, delicate boy sat with \n",
      "shining eyes unnoticed in a corner, starting every now and \n",
      "then and muttering something to himself, and evidently \n",
      "experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his \n",
      "curly head, with his thin neck exposed by his turn-down \n",
      "collar, toward the place where Pierre sat. \n",
      "The conversation turned on the contemporary gossip \n",
      "about those in power, in whic h most people see the chief \n",
      "interest of home politics. Denisov, dissatisfied with the \n",
      "government on account of his own disappointments in the \n",
      "service, heard with pleasure of the things done in \n",
      "Petersburg which seemed to him stupid, and made \n",
      "forcible and sharp comments on what Pierre told them. \n",
      "‘One used to have to be a German- now one must \n",
      "dance with Tatawinova and Madame Kwudener, and \n",
      "wead Ecka’tshausen and the bwethwen. Oh, they should \n",
      "let that fine fellow Bonapart e lose- he’d knock all this \n",
      "nonsense out of them! Fancy giving the command of the \n",

      "2765 of 2882 \n",
      "Semenov wegiment to a fellow like that Schwa’tz!’ he \n",
      "cried. \n",
      "Nicholas, though free from Denisov’s readiness to find \n",
      "fault with everything, also t hought that discussion of the \n",
      "government was a very serious  and weighty matter, and \n",
      "the fact that A had been appoi nted Minister of This and B \n",
      "Governor General of That, an d that the Emperor had said \n",
      "so-and-so and this minister so-and-so, seemed to him very \n",
      "important. And so he thought it necessary to take an \n",
      "interest in these things and to question Pierre. The \n",
      "questions put by these two ke pt the conversation from \n",
      "changing its ordinary character of gossi p about the higher \n",
      "government circles. \n",
      "But Natasha, knowing all her husband’s ways and \n",

      "unable to divert the conversation to another channel and \n",
      "express his own deeply felt id ea for the sake of which he \n",
      "had gone to Petersburg to consult with his new friend \n",
      "Prince Theodore, and she he lped him by asking how his \n",
      "affairs with Prince Theodore had gone. \n",
      "‘What was it about?’ asked Nicholas. \n",
      "‘Always the same thing,’ said Pierre, looking round at \n",
      "his listeners. ‘Everybody sees  that things are going so \n",
      "badly that they cannot be allowed to go on so and that it is War and Peace  \n",
      "2766 of 2882 \n",
      "the duty of all decent men to counteract it as far as they \n",
      "can.’ \n",
      "‘What can decent men do?’ Nicholas inquired, \n",
      "frowning slightly. ‘What can be done?’ \n",
      "‘Why, this..’ \n",
      "‘Come into my study,’ said Nicholas. \n",
      "Natasha, who had long expected to be fetched to nurse \n",
      "her baby, now heard the nurse calling her and went to the \n",
      "nursery. Countess Mary followe d her. The men went into \n",
      "the study and little Nicholas Bolkonski followed them \n",
      "unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table in \n",
      "a shady corner by the window. \n",
      "‘Well, what would you do?’ asked Denisov. \n",
      "‘Always some fantastic schemes,’ said Nicholas. \n",
      "‘Why this,’ began Pierre, not sitting down but pacing \n",
      "the room, sometimes stopping short, gesticulating, and \n",
      "lisping: ‘the position in Petersburg is this: the Emperor \n",
      "does not look into anything. He has abandoned himself \n",
      "altogether to this mysticism’ (Pierre could not tolerate \n",
      "mysticism in anyone now). ‘He seeks only for peace, and \n",
      "only these people sans foi ni loi* can give it him- people \n",
      "who recklessly hack at a nd strangle everything- \n",
      "Magnitski, Arakcheev, and tutti quanti.... You will agree \n",
      "that if you did not look after your estates yourself but only \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2767 of 2882 \n",
      "wanted a quiet life, the harsher your steward was the more \n",
      "readily your object might be attained,’ he said to \n",
      "Nicholas. \n",
      "*Without faith or law. \n",
      "‘Well, what does that lead up to?’ said Nicholas. \n",
      "‘Well, everything is going to ruin! Robbery in the law \n",
      "courts, in the army noth ing but flogging, drilling, and \n",
      "Military Settlements; the people are tortured, \n",
      "enlightenment is suppressed. All that is young and honest \n",
      "is crushed! Everyone sees that this cannot go on. \n",
      "Everything is strain ed to such a degree that it will \n",
      "certainly break,’ said Pierre (as those who examine the \n",
      "actions of any government have always said since \n",
      "governments began). ‘I told them just one thing in \n",
      "Petersburg.’ \n",
      "‘Told whom?’ \n",
      "‘Well, you know whom,’ said Pierre, with a meaning \n",
      "glance from under his brows. ‘Prince Theodore and all \n",
      "those. To encourage culture and philanthropy is all very \n",
      "well of course. The aim is ex cellent but in the present \n",
      "circumstances something else is needed.’ \n",
      "At that moment Nicholas noticed the presence of his \n",
      "nephew. His face darkened and he went up to the boy. \n",
      "‘Why are you here?’ War and Peace  \n",
      "2768 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Why? Let him be,’ said Pierre, taking Nicholas by the \n",
      "arm and continuing. ‘That is not enough, I told them. \n",
      "Something else is needed. Wh en you stand expecting the \n",
      "overstrained string to snap at any moment, when everyone \n",
      "is expecting the inevitabl e catastrophe, as many as \n",
      "possible must join hands as closely as they can to \n",
      "withstand the general calam ity. Everything that is young \n",
      "and strong is being enticed away and depraved. One is \n",
      "lured by women, another by honors, a third by ambition \n",
      "or money, and they go over to that camp. No independent \n",
      "men, such as you or I, are le ft. What I say is widen the \n",
      "scope of our society, let the mot d’ordre be not virtue \n",
      "alone but independence and action as well!’ \n",
      "Nicholas, who had left his nephew, irritably pushed up \n",
      "an armchair, sat down in it, and listened to Pierre, \n",
      "coughing discontentedly and frowning more and more. \n",
      "‘But action with what aim? ’ he cried. ‘And what \n",
      "position will you adopt toward the government?’ \n",
      "‘Why, the position of assistants. The society need not \n",
      "be secret if the government allows it. Not merely is it not \n",
      "hostile to government, but it is a society of true \n",
      "conservatives- a society of gentlemen in the full meaning \n",
      "of that word. It is only to prevent some Pugachev or other \n",
      "from killing my children and yours, and Arakcheev from \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2769 of 2882 \n",
      "sending me off to some Military Settlement. We join \n",
      "hands only for the public welfare and the general safety.’ \n",
      "‘Yes, but it’s a secret soci ety and therefore a hostile \n",
      "and harmful one which can only cause harm.’ \n",
      "‘Why? Did the Tugendbund which saved Europe’ \n",
      "(they did not then venture to suggest that Russia had \n",
      "saved Europe) ‘do any harm? The Tugendbund is an \n",
      "alliance of virtue: it is love, mutual help... it is what Christ \n",
      "preached on the Cross.’ \n",
      "Natasha, who had come in during the conversation, \n",
      "looked joyfully at her husba nd. It was not what he was \n",
      "saying that pleased her- that di d not even interest her, for \n",
      "it seemed to her that was all extremely simple and that she \n",
      "had known it a long time (it seemed so to her because she \n",
      "knew that it sprang from Pierre ’s whole soul), but it was \n",
      "his animated and enthusiastic  appearance that made her \n",
      "glad. \n",
      "The boy with the thin neck stretching out from the \n",
      "turn-down collar- whom everyone had forgotten- gazed at \n",
      "Pierre with even greater a nd more rapturous joy. Every \n",
      "word of Pierre’s burned into his heart, and with a nervous \n",
      "movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the \n",
      "sealing wax and quill pens his hands came upon on his \n",
      "uncle’s table. War and Peace  \n",
      "2770 of 2882 \n",

      "German Tugendbund was, and what I am proposing.’ \n",
      "‘No, my fwiend! The Tugendbund is all vewy well for \n",
      "the sausage eaters, but I don’t understand it and can’t \n",

      "*\"I’m your man.’ \n",
      "Pierre smiled, Natasha bega n to laugh, but Nicholas \n",
      "knitted his brows still more and began proving to Pierre \n",
      "that there was no prospect of any great change and that all \n",
      "the danger he spoke of existe d only in his imagination. \n",
      "Pierre maintained the contrary, and as his mental faculties \n",
      "were greater and more resour ceful, Nicholas felt himself \n",
      "cornered. This made him still angrier, for he was fully \n",
      "convinced, not by reasoning but  by something within him \n",
      "stronger than reason, of the justice of his opinion. \n",
      "‘I will tell you this,’ he said , rising and trying with \n",
      "nervously twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a \n",
      "corner, but finally abandoning the attempt. ‘I can’t prove \n",
      "it to you. You say that everything here is rotten and that \n",
      "an overthrow is coming: I don’ t see it. But you also say \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2771 of 2882 \n",
      "that our oath of allegiance is a conditional matter, and to \n",
      "that I reply: ‘You are my best  friend, as you know, but if \n",
      "you formed a secret society and began working against \n",
      "the government- be it what it may- I know it is my duty to \n",
      "obey the government. And if Arakcheev ordered me to \n",
      "lead a squadron against you and cut you down, I should \n",
      "not hesitate an instant, but shoul d do it.’ And you may \n",
      "argue about that as you like!’ \n",
      "An awkward silence followed these words. Natasha \n",
      "was the first to speak, defending her husband and \n",
      "attacking her brother. Her defense was weak and inapt but \n",
      "she attained her object. The conversation was resumed, \n",
      "and no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of \n",
      "Nicholas’ last remark. \n",
      "When they all got up to go in to supper, little Nicholas \n",

      "that conversation, and rememb ering all he had said he War and Peace  \n",
      "2772 of 2882 \n",
      "regretted that the lad should have heard him. He had, \n",
      "however, to give him an answer. \n",
      "‘Yes, I think so,’ he said reluctantly, and left the study. \n",
      "The lad looked down and seemed now for the first time \n",
      "to notice what he had done to  the things on the table. He \n",
      "flushed and went up to Nicholas. \n",
      "‘Uncle, forgive me, I did that... unintentionally,’ he \n",
      "said, pointing to the broken sealing wax and pens. \n",
      "Nicholas started angrily. \n",
      "‘All right, all righ t,’ he said, throwing the bits under \n",
      "the table. \n",
      "And evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty, \n",
      "he turned away from the boy. \n",
      "‘You ought not to have been here at all,’ he said. \n",

      "2773 of 2882 \n",
      "Chapter XV \n",
      "The conversation at supper was not about politics or \n",
      "societies, but turned on the subject Nicholas liked best- \n",
      "recollections of 1812. Denisov started these and Pierre \n",
      "was particularly agreeable and amusing about them. The \n",
      "family separated on the most friendly terms. \n",
      "After supper Nicholas, havi ng undressed in his study \n",
      "and given instructions to the steward who had been \n",
      "waiting for him, went to the bedroom in his dressing \n",
      "gown, where he found his wife still at her table, writing. \n",
      "‘What are you writing, Mary?’ Nicholas asked. \n",
      "Countess Mary blushed. She was afraid that what she \n",
      "was writing would not be understood or approved by her \n",
      "husband. \n",
      "She had wanted to conceal what she was writing from \n",
      "him, but at the same time was glad he had surprised her at \n",

      "‘A diary, Nicholas,’ she replied, handing him a blue \n",
      "exercise book filled with her firm, bold writing. \n",
      "‘A diary?’ Nicholas repeat ed with a shade of irony, \n",
      "and he took up the book. \n",
      "It was in French. War and Peace  \n",
      "2774 of 2882 \n",
      "December 4. Today when Andrusha (her eldest boy) \n",
      "woke up he did not wish to dress and Mademoiselle \n",
      "Louise sent for me. He was naughty and obstinate. I tried \n",
      "threats, but he only grew angrier. Then I took the matter \n",
      "in hand: I left him alone and began with nurse’s help to \n",
      "get the other children up, telling him that I did not love \n",
      "him. For a long time he was silent, as if astonished, then \n",
      "he jumped out of bed, ran to me in his shirt, and sobbed \n",
      "so that I could not calm him for a long time. It was plain \n",
      "that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me. \n",
      "Afterwards in the evening when I gave him his ticket, he \n",

      "‘What is a ‘ticket’?’ Nicholas inquired. \n",

      "evening, showing how they have behaved.’ \n",
      "Nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing \n",
      "at him, and continued to turn  over the pages and read. In \n",

      "characters or suggesting general reflections on \n",

      "2775 of 2882 \n",

      "Under the date ‘5’ was entered: \n",

      "no pudding. He had none, but looked so unhappily and \n",
      "greedily at the others while they were eating! I think that \n",
      "punishment by depriving children of sweets only develops \n",
      "their greediness. Must tell Nicholas this. \n",
      "Nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife. \n",

      "spiritual effort of which the sole aim was the children’s \n",
      "moral welfare delighted him. Had Nicholas been able to \n",

      "almost beyond his reach, in which she had her being. \n",
      "He was proud of her intelligence and goodness, \n",

      "sayings...’ added Nicholas, yiel ding to that irresistible \n",
      "inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and \n",
      "dearest to us. He forgot that what he was saying about \n",

      "course he is right there,’ said Countess Mary, ‘but he \n",

      "everything on my table to bi ts, and he told me of it \n",
      "himself at once! I never knew him to tell an untruth. A \n",
      "fine lad, a fine lad!’ repeated Nicholas, who at heart was \n",
      "not fond of Nicholas Bolkonski but was always anxious to \n",
      "recognize that he was a fine lad. \n",
      "‘Still, I am not the same as his own mother,’ said \n",

      "‘Well, what business is it of mine what goes on there- \n",
      "whether Arakcheev is bad, and all that? What business \n",

      "was.’ \n",
      "Countess Mary wanted to tell him that man does not \n",
      "live by bread alone and that  he attached too much \n",
      "importance to these matters. But she knew she must not \n",
      "say this and that it would be useless to do so. She only \n",
      "took his hand and kissed it. He took this as a sign of \n",

      "thinking about something else. But she had to force \n",
      "herself to attend, for what he  was saying did not interest War and Peace  \n",
      "2780 of 2882 \n",
      "her at all. She looked at him and did not think, but felt, \n",
      "about something different. She felt a submissive tender \n",
      "love for this man who would never understand all that she \n",
      "understood, and this seemed to make her love for him still \n",
      "stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness. \n",

      "hindered her from following th e details of her husband’s \n",
      "plans, thoughts that had no c onnection with what he was \n",
      "saying flitted through her mind. She thought of her \n",
      "nephew. Her husband’s account of the boy’s agitation \n",
      "while Pierre was speaking struck her forcibly, and various \n",
      "traits of his gentle, sensitive character recurred to her \n",
      "mind; and while thinking of her nephew she thought also \n",
      "of her own children. She did not  compare them with him, \n",
      "but compared her feeling for them with her feeling for \n",
      "him, and felt with regret that there was something lacking \n",
      "in her feeling for young Nicholas. \n",
      "Sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose \n",
      "from the difference in their ages, but she felt herself to \n",
      "blame toward him and promised in her heart to do better \n",
      "and to accomplish the impossible- in this life to love her \n",
      "husband, her children,  little Nicholas, and all her \n",
      "neighbors, as Christ loved mankind. Countess Mary’s \n",

      "2781 of 2882 \n",
      "absolute, and could therefore never be at peace. A stern \n",

      "by the body appeared on her face. Nicholas gazed at her. \n",
      "‘O God! What will become of us if she dies, as I always \n",

      "Chapter XVI \n",
      "Natasha and Pierre, left alone , also began to talk as \n",
      "only a husband and wife can talk, that is, with \n",
      "extraordinary clearness a nd rapidity, understanding and \n",
      "expressing each other’s thoughts in ways contrary to all \n",
      "rules of logic, without premises, deductions, or \n",
      "conclusions, and in a quite p eculiar way. Natasha was so \n",
      "used to this kind of talk with her husband that for her it \n",
      "was the surest sign of something being wrong between \n",
      "them if Pierre followed a lin e of logical reasoning. When \n",
      "he began proving anything, or  talking argumentatively \n",
      "and calmly and she, led on by his example, began to do \n",
      "the same, she knew that they were on the verge of a \n",
      "quarrel. \n",
      "From the moment they were alone and Natasha came \n",
      "up to him with wide-open happy eyes, and quickly seizing \n",
      "his head pressed it to her bosom, saying: ‘Now you are all \n",
      "mine, mine! You won’t escape! ’- from that moment this \n",
      "conversation began, contrary to all the laws of logic and \n",
      "contrary to them because quite different subjects were \n",
      "talked about at one and the same time. This simultaneous \n",
      "discussion of many topics did not prevent a clear \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2783 of 2882 \n",
      "understanding but on the contrary was the surest sign that \n",
      "they fully understood one another. \n",
      "Just as in a dream when all is uncertain, unreasoning, \n",
      "and contradictory, except th e feeling that guides the \n",
      "dream, so in this intercourse contrary to all laws of \n",
      "reason, the words themselves were not consecutive and \n",
      "clear but only the feeling that prompted them. \n",
      "Natasha spoke to Pierre a bout her brother’s life and \n",
      "doings, of how she had suffered and lacked life during his \n",
      "own absence, and of how she was fonder than ever of \n",
      "Mary, and how Mary was in  every way better than \n",
      "herself. In saying this Natasha was sincere in \n",
      "acknowledging Mary’s superiority, but at the same time \n",
      "by saying it she made a demand on Pierre that he should, \n",
      "all the same, prefer her to Mary and to all other women, \n",
      "and that now, especially after having seen many women \n",
      "in Petersburg, he should tell her so afresh. \n",
      "Pierre, answering Natasha’s words, told her how \n",
      "intolerable it had been for hi m to meet ladies at dinners \n",
      "and balls in Petersburg. \n",
      "‘I have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies,’ he \n",
      "said. ‘It was simply dull. Besides, I was very busy.’ \n",
      "Natasha looked intently at him and went on: War and Peace  \n",
      "2784 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Mary is so splendid,’ she said. ‘How she understands \n",
      "children! It is as if she sa w straight into their souls. \n",
      "Yesterday, for instance, Mitya was naughty..’ \n",
      "‘How like his father he is,’ Pierre interjected. \n",
      "Natasha knew why he mentioned Mitya’s likeness to \n",
      "Nicholas: the recollection of his dispute with his brother-\n",
      "in-law was unpleasant and he  wanted to know what \n",
      "Natasha thought of it. \n",
      "‘Nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with \n",
      "anything not generally accepted. But I understand that \n",
      "you value what opens up a fresh line,’ said she, repeating \n",
      "words Pierre had once uttered. \n",
      "‘No, the chief point is that  to Nicholas ideas and \n",
      "discussions are an amusement- almost a pastime,’ said \n",
      "Pierre. ‘For instance, he is  collecting a library and has \n",
      "made it a rule not to  buy a new book till he has read what \n",
      "he had already bought- Sismondi and Rousseau and \n",
      "Montesquieu,’ he added w ith a smile. ‘You know how \n",
      "much I...’ he began to soften down what he had said; but \n",
      "Natasha interrupted him to show that this was \n",
      "unnecessary. \n",
      "‘So you say ideas are an amusement to him...’ \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2785 of 2882 \n",
      "‘Yes, and for me nothing else is serious. All the time in \n",
      "Petersburg I saw everyone as in a dream. When I am \n",
      "taken up by a thought, all else is mere amusement.’ \n",
      "‘Ah, I’m so sorry I wasn’t there when you met the \n",
      "children,’ said Natasha. ‘Which was most delighted? Lisa, \n",
      "I’m sure.’ \n",
      "‘Yes,’ Pierre replied, and went on with what was in his \n",
      "mind. ‘Nicholas says we ought not to think. But I can’t \n",
      "help it. Besides, when I was in Petersburg I felt (I can this \n",
      "to you) that the whole affair  would go to pieces without \n",
      "me- everyone was pulling his own way. But I succeeded \n",
      "in uniting them all; and then my idea is so clear and \n",
      "simple. You see, I don’t say that we ought to oppose this \n",
      "and that. We may be mistaken. What I say is: ‘Join hands, \n",
      "you who love the right, and le t there be but one banner- \n",
      "that of active virtue.’ Prince Sergey is a fine fellow and \n",
      "clever.’ \n",
      "Natasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness \n",
      "of Pierre’s idea, but one thing disconcerted her. ‘Can a \n",
      "man so important and necessary to society be also my \n",
      "husband? How did this happen? ’ She wished to express \n",
      "this doubt to him. ‘Now who could decide whether he is \n",
      "really cleverer than all the others?’ she asked herself, and \n",
      "passed in review all those w hom Pierre most respected. War and Peace  \n",
      "2786 of 2882 \n",
      "Judging by what he had said there was no one he had \n",
      "respected so highly as Platon Karataev. \n",
      "‘Do you know what I am thinking about?’ she asked. \n",
      "‘About Platon Karataev. Would he have approved of you \n",
      "now, do you think?’ \n",
      "Pierre was not at all surpri sed at this question. He \n",
      "understood his wife’s line of thought. \n",
      "‘Platon Karataev?’ he repeated, and pondered, \n",
      "evidently sincerely trying to imagine Karataev’s opinion \n",
      "on the subject. ‘He would not have understood... yet \n",
      "perhaps he would.’ \n",
      "‘I love you awfully!’ Natasha suddenly said. ‘Awfully, \n",
      "awfully!’ \n",
      "‘No, he would not have approved,’ said Pierre, after \n",
      "reflection. ‘What he would have approved of is our family \n",
      "life. He was always so a nxious to find seemliness, \n",
      "happiness, and peace in everything, and I should have \n",
      "been proud to let him see us . There now- you talk of my \n",
      "absence, but you wouldn’t believe what a special feeling I \n",
      "have for you after a separation...’ \n",
      "‘Yes, I should think...’ Natasha began. \n",
      "‘No, it’s not that. I never leave off loving you. And one \n",
      "couldn’t love more, but this is something special.... Yes, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2787 of 2882 \n",
      "of course-’ he did not finish  because their eyes meeting \n",
      "said the rest. \n",
      "‘What nonsense it is,’ Natasha suddenly exclaimed, \n",
      "‘about honeymoons, and that the greatest happiness is at \n",
      "first! On the contrary, now is the best of all. If only you \n",
      "did not go away! Do you remember how we quarreled? \n",
      "And it was always my fault. Always mine. And what we \n",
      "quarreled about- I don’t even remember!’ \n",
      "‘Always about the same thi ng,’ said Pierre with a \n",
      "smile. ‘Jealo..’ \n",
      "‘Don’t say it! I can’t bear it!’ Natasha cried, and her \n",
      "eyes glittered coldly and vindictively. ‘Did you see her?’ \n",
      "she added, after a pause. \n",
      "‘No, and if I had I shouldn’t have recognized her.’ \n",
      "They were silent for a while. \n",
      "‘Oh, do you know? While you were talking in the \n",
      "study I was looking at you,’ Natasha began, evidently \n",
      "anxious to disperse the cloud that had come over them. \n",
      "‘You are as like him as two peas- like the boy.’ (She \n",
      "meant her little son.) ‘Oh, it’s time to go to him.... The \n",
      "milk’s come.... But I’m sorry to leave you.’ \n",
      "They were silent for a few seconds. Then suddenly \n",
      "turning to one another at the same time they both began to \n",
      "speak. Pierre began with self -satisfaction and enthusiasm, \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2788 of 2882 \n",
      "Natasha with a quiet, happy smile. Having interrupted one \n",
      "another they both stopped to let the other continue. \n",
      "‘No. What did you say? Go on, go on.’ \n",
      "‘No, you go on, I was talking nonsense,’ said Natasha. \n",
      "Pierre finished what he ha d begun. It was the sequel to \n",
      "his complacent reflections on his success in Petersburg. \n",
      "At that moment it seemed to him that he was chosen to \n",
      "give a new direction to the whole of Russian society and \n",
      "to the whole world. \n",
      "‘I only wished to say that id eas that have great results \n",
      "are always simple ones. My w hole idea is that if vicious \n",
      "people are united and constitute a power, then honest folk \n",
      "must do the same. Now that’s simple enough.’ \n",
      "‘Yes.’ \n",
      "‘And what were you going to say?’ \n",
      "‘I? Only nonsense.’ \n",
      "‘But all the same?’ \n",
      "‘Oh nothing, only a trifle,’ said Natasha, smilingly still \n",
      "more brightly. ‘I only wanted to tell you about Petya: \n",
      "today nurse was coming to ta ke him from me, and he \n",
      "laughed, shut his eyes, and clung to me. I’m sure he \n",
      "thought he was hiding. Awfully  sweet! There, now he’s \n",
      "crying. Well, good-by!’ and she left the room. \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2789 of 2882 \n",
      "Meanwhile downstairs in young Nicholas Bolkonski’s \n",
      "bedroom a little lamp was burning as usual. (The boy was \n",
      "afraid of the dark and they  could not cure him of it.) \n",
      "Dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and his Roman \n",
      "nose emitted sounds of rhythmic  snoring. Little Nicholas, \n",
      "who had just waked up in a cold perspirati on, sat up in \n",
      "bed and gazed before him with wide-open eyes. He had \n",
      "awaked from a terrible dream. He had dreamed that he \n",
      "and Uncle Pierre, wearing helmets such as were depicted \n",
      "in his Plutarch, were leadi ng a huge army. The army was \n",
      "made up of white slanting lines  that filled the air like the \n",
      "cobwebs that float about in  autumn and which Dessalles \n",
      "called les fils de la Vierge. In front was Glory, which was \n",
      "similar to those threads but rather thicker. He and Pierre \n",
      "were borne along lightly and joyously, nearer and nearer \n",
      "to their goal. Suddenly the threads that moved them began \n",
      "to slacken and become entangled and it grew difficult to \n",
      "move. And Uncle Nicholas st ood before them in a stern \n",
      "and threatening attitude. \n",
      "‘Have you done this?’ he said, pointing to some broken \n",
      "sealing wax and pens. ‘I loved you, but I have orders from \n",
      "Arakcheev and will kill the first of you who moves \n",
      "forward.’ Little Nicholas tu rned to look at Pierre but \n",
      "Pierre was no longer there. In his place was his father- War and Peace  \n",
      "2790 of 2882 \n",
      "Prince Andrew- and his father had neither shape nor form, \n",
      "but he existed, and when little Nicholas perceived him he \n",
      "grew faint with love: he fe lt himself powerless, limp, and \n",
      "formless. His father caressed and pitied him. But Uncle \n",
      "Nicholas came nearer and nearer to them. Terror seized \n",
      "young Nicholas and he awoke. \n",
      "‘My father!’ he thought. (Though there were two good \n",
      "portraits of Prince Andrew in  the house, Nicholas never \n",
      "imagined him in human form.)  ‘My father has been with \n",
      "me and caressed me. He appr oved of me and of Uncle \n",
      "Pierre. Whatever he may tell me, I will do it. Mucius \n",

      "History is the life of nations  and of humanity. To seize \n",
      "and put into words, to describe directly the life of \n",
      "humanity or even of a single nation, appears impossible. \n",
      "The ancient historians all employed one and the same \n",
      "method to describe and seize the apparently elusive- the \n",
      "life of a people. They describe d the activity of individuals \n",
      "who ruled the people, and regarded the activity of those \n",
      "men as representing the activity of the whole nation. \n",
      "The question: how did indivi duals make nations act as \n",
      "they wished and by what was th e will of these individuals \n",
      "themselves guided? the ancients met by recognizing a \n",
      "divinity which subjected th e nations to the will of a \n",
      "chosen man, and guided the will of that chosen man so as \n",
      "to accomplish ends that were predestined. \n",
      "For the ancients these questions were solved by a \n",
      "belief in the direct participation of the Deity in human \n",
      "affairs. \n",
      "Modern history, in theory, rejects both these principles. \n",
      "It would seem that having re jected the belief of the \n",
      "ancients in man’s subjection to the Deity and in a \n",
      "predetermined aim toward whic h nations are led, modern \n",
      "history should study not the manifestations of power but War and Peace  \n",
      "2794 of 2882 \n",
      "the causes that produce it. But modern history has not \n",
      "done this. Having in theory rejected the view held by the \n",
      "ancients, it still follows them in practice. \n",
      "Instead of men endowed w ith divine authority and \n",
      "directly guided by the will of  God, modern history has \n",
      "given us either heroes endowed with extraordinary, \n",
      "superhuman capacities, or si mply men of very various \n",
      "kinds, from monarchs to journa lists, who lead the masses. \n",
      "Instead of the former divinely appointed aims of the \n",
      "Jewish, Greek, or Roman nations, which ancient \n",
      "historians regarded as re presenting the progress of \n",
      "humanity, modern history ha s postulated its own aims- \n",
      "the welfare of the French, German, or English people, or, \n",
      "in its highest abstraction, th e welfare and civilization of \n",
      "humanity in general, by which is usually meant that of the \n",
      "peoples occupying a small nor thwesterly portion of a \n",
      "large continent. \n",
      "Modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients \n",
      "without replacing them by a new conception, and the \n",
      "logic of the situation has oblig ed the historians, after they \n",
      "had apparently rejected the divine authority of the kings \n",
      "and the ‘fate’ of the ancients, to reach the same \n",
      "conclusion by another road, that is, to recognize (1) \n",
      "nations guided by individual men, and (2) the existence of \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2795 of 2882 \n",
      "a known aim to which these nations and humanity at large \n",
      "are tending. \n",
      "At the basis of the works of  all the modern historians \n",
      "from Gibbon to Buckle, despite their seeming \n",
      "disagreements and the apparent  novelty of their outlooks, \n",
      "lie those two old, unavoidable assumptions. \n",

      "(one historian considers onl y monarchs, generals, and \n",
      "ministers as being such men, while another includes also \n",
      "orators, learned men, reformers, philosophers, and poets). \n",
      "Secondly, it is assumed that the goal toward which \n",
      "humanity is being led is known to the historians: to one of \n",
      "them this goal is the greatness of the Roman, Spanish, or \n",
      "French realm; to another it  is liberty, equality, and a \n",
      "certain kind of civilization of  a small corner of the world \n",
      "called Europe. \n",
      "In 1789 a ferment arises in Paris; it grows, spreads, and \n",
      "is expressed by a movement of peoples from west to east. \n",
      "Several times it moves eastward and collides with a \n",
      "countermovement from the east westward. In 1812 it \n",
      "reaches its extreme limit, Moscow, and then, with \n",
      "remarkable symmetry, a countermovement occurs from \n",
      "east to west, attracting to it, as the first movement had War and Peace  \n",
      "2796 of 2882 \n",
      "done, the nations of middl e Europe. The counter \n",
      "movement reaches the starting point of the first movement \n",
      "in the west- Paris- and subsides. \n",
      "During that twenty-year period an immense number of \n",
      "fields were left untille d, houses were burned, trade \n",
      "changed its direction, milli ons of men migrated, were \n",
      "impoverished, or were enriched, and millions of Christian \n",
      "men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one \n",
      "another. \n",
      "What does all this mean? Why did it happen? What \n",
      "made those people burn houses and slay their fellow men? \n",
      "What were the causes of these events? What force made \n",
      "men act so? These are the instinctive, plain, and most \n",
      "legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it \n",
      "encounters the monuments and tradition of that period. \n",
      "For a reply to these questions the common sense of \n",
      "mankind turns to the science of  history, whose aim is to \n",
      "enable nations and humanity to know themselves. \n",
      "If history had retained the c onception of the ancients it \n",
      "would have said that God, to reward or punish his people, \n",
      "gave Napoleon power and directed his will to the \n",
      "fulfillment of the divine ends, and that reply, would have \n",
      "been clear and complete. One might believe or disbelieve \n",
      "in the divine significance of Napoleon, but for anyone \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2797 of 2882 \n",
      "believing in it there would have been nothing \n",
      "unintelligible in the history of that period, nor would there \n",
      "have been any contradictions. \n",
      "But modern history cannot give that reply. Science \n",
      "does not admit the conception of  the ancients as to the \n",
      "direct participation of the Deity in human affairs, and \n",
      "therefore history ought to give other answers. \n",
      "Modern history replying to these questions says: you \n",
      "want to know what this movement means, what caused it, \n",
      "and what force produced these events? Then listen: \n",
      "‘Louis XIV was a very proud and self-confident man; \n",
      "he had such and such mistresses and such and such \n",
      "ministers and he ruled Fr ance badly. His descendants \n",
      "were weak men and they t oo ruled France badly. And \n",
      "they had such and such fa vorites and such and such \n",
      "mistresses. Moreover, certai n men wrote some books at \n",
      "that time. At the end of the eighteenth century there were \n",
      "a couple of dozen men in Paris who began to talk about \n",
      "all men being free and equal. This caused people all over \n",
      "France to begin to slash at and drown one another. They \n",
      "killed the king and many other people. At that time there \n",
      "was in France a man of genius- Napoleon. He conquered \n",
      "everybody everywhere- that is , he killed many people \n",
      "because he was a great genius. And for some reason he War and Peace  \n",
      "2798 of 2882 \n",
      "went to kill Africans, and killed them so well and was so \n",
      "cunning and wise that when he returned to France he \n",
      "ordered everybody to obey him,  and they all obeyed him. \n",
      "Having become an Emperor he again went out to kill \n",
      "people in Italy, Austria, and Prussia. And there too he \n",
      "killed a great many. In Russia there was an Emperor, \n",
      "Alexander, who decided to re store order in Europe and \n",
      "therefore fought against Na poleon. In 1807 he suddenly \n",
      "made friends with him, but in 1811 they again quarreled \n",
      "and again began killing ma ny people. Napoleon led six \n",
      "hundred thousand men into Russia and captured Moscow; \n",
      "then he suddenly ran away from Moscow, and the \n",
      "Emperor Alexander, helped by the advice of Stein and \n",
      "others, united Europe to arm against the disturber of its \n",
      "peace. All Napoleon’s allies suddenly became his enemies \n",
      "and their forces advanced ag ainst the fresh forces he \n",
      "raised. The Allies defeated Napoleon, entered Paris, \n",
      "forced Napoleon to abdicate, and sent him to the island of \n",
      "Elba, not depriving him of the title of Emperor and \n",
      "showing him every respect, t hough five years before and \n",
      "one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a \n",

      "defeated the genius Napole on and, suddenly recognizing \n",
      "him as a brigand, sent him to  the island of St. Helena. \n",
      "And the exile, separated from the beloved France so dear \n",

      "It would be a mistake to th ink that this is ironic- a \n",
      "caricature of the historical acc ounts. On the contrary it is \n",

      "What force moves the nations? \n",
      "Biographical historians and historians of separate \n",
      "nations understand this for ce as a power inherent in \n",
      "heroes and rulers. In their narration events occur solely by \n",
      "the will of a Napoleon, and Alex ander, or in general of \n",
      "the persons they describe. The answers given by this kind \n",
      "of historian to the question of what force causes events to \n",
      "happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one \n",
      "historian to each event. As s oon as historians of different \n",
      "nationalities and tendencies be gin to describe the same \n",
      "event, the replies they give immediately lose all meaning, \n",
      "for this force is understood by them all not only \n",
      "differently but often in qu ite contradictory ways. One \n",
      "historian says that an event was produced by Napoleon’s \n",
      "power, another that it wa s produced by Alexander’s, a \n",
      "third that it was due to th e power of some other person. \n",
      "Besides this, historians of th at kind contradict each other \n",
      "even in their statement as to the force on which the \n",
      "authority of some particular person was based. Thiers, a \n",
      "Bonapartist, says that Napoleon’s power was based on his \n",
      "virtue and genius. Lanfrey, a Republican, says it was \n",
      "War and Peace  \n",
      "2803 of 2882 \n",
      "based on his trickery and deception of the people. So the \n",
      "historians of this class, by mutually destroying one \n",
      "another’s positions, destroy the understanding of the force \n",
      "which produces events, and furnish no reply to history’s \n",
      "essential question. \n",
      "Writers of universal histor y who deal with all the \n",
      "nations seem to recognize how  erroneous is the specialist \n",
      "historians’ view of the force which produces events. They \n",
      "do not recognize it as a power  inherent in heroes and \n",
      "rulers, but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously \n",
      "directed forces. In describing a war or the subjugation of a \n",
      "people, a general historian looks for the cause of the event \n",
      "not in the power of one man, but in the interaction of \n",
      "many persons connected with the event. \n",
      "According to this view the power of historical \n",
      "personages, represented as the product of many forces, \n",
      "can no longer, it would seem, be  regarded as a force that \n",
      "itself produces events. Yet in most cases universal \n",
      "historians still employ the conception of power as a force \n",
      "that itself produces events, a nd treat it as their cause. In \n",
      "their exposition, an historic character is first the product \n",
      "of his time, and his power onl y the resultant  of various \n",
      "forces, and then his power is itself a force producing \n",
      "events. Gervinus, Schlosser, and others, for instance, at War and Peace  \n",
      "2804 of 2882 \n",
      "one time prove Napoleon to be a product of the \n",
      "Revolution, of the ideas of 1789 and so forth, and at \n",
      "another plainly say that the campaign of 1812 and other \n",
      "things they do not like were simply the product of \n",
      "Napoleon’s misdirected will, and that the very ideas of \n",
      "1789 were arrested in their development by Napoleon’s \n",
      "caprice. The ideas of the Revolution and the general \n",
      "temper of the age produced Napoleon’s power. But \n",
      "Napoleon’s power suppressed the ideas of the Revolution \n",
      "and the general temper of the age. \n",
      "This curious contradiction is not accidental. Not only \n",
      "does it occur at every step, but  the universal historians’ \n",
      "accounts are all made up of a chain of such \n",
      "contradictions. This contradi ction occurs because after \n",
      "entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop \n",
      "halfway. \n",
      "To find component forces equal to the composite or \n",
      "resultant force, the sum of the components must equal the \n",
      "resultant. This condition is never observed by the \n",
      "universal historians, and so to  explain the resultant forces \n",
      "they are obliged to admit, in  addition to the insufficient \n",
      "components, another unexplained force affecting the \n",
      "resultant action. \n",

      "2805 of 2882 \n",
      "Specialist historians desc ribing the campaign of 1813 \n",
      "or the restoration of the Bour bons plainly assert that these \n",
      "events were produced by the will of Alexander. But the \n",
      "universal historian Gervinus, refuting this opinion of the \n",
      "specialist historian, tries to prove that the campaign of \n",
      "1813 and the restoration of the Bourbons were due to \n",
      "other things beside Alexander’s will- such as the activity \n",
      "of Stein, Metternich, Madame de Stael, Talleyrand, Fichte \n",
      "Chateaubriand, and others. The historian evidently \n",
      "decomposes Alexander’s pow er into the components: \n",
      "Talleyrand, Chateaubriand, and the rest- but the sum of \n",
      "the components, that is, the interactions of Chateaubriand, \n",
      "Talleyrand, Madame de Stael, and the others, evidently \n",
      "does not equal the resultant, namely the phenomenon of \n",
      "millions of Frenchmen submitting to the Bourbons. That \n",
      "Chateaubriand, Madame de Stael, and others spoke \n",
      "certain words to one another only affected their mutual \n",
      "relations but does not account for the submission of \n",

      "relations of theirs the submission of millions of people \n",
      "resulted- that is, how compone nt forces equal to one A \n",
      "gave a resultant equal to a thousand times A- the historian \n",

      "2806 of 2882 \n",
      "that is, he has to admit an unexplained force acting on the \n",
      "resultant. And that is just what the universal historians do, \n",
      "and consequently they not onl y contradict the specialist \n",
      "historians but contradict themselves. \n",
      "Peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain, say, \n",
      "according to whether they want rain or fine weather: ‘The \n",
      "wind has blown the clouds away,’ or, ‘The wind has \n",
      "brought up the clouds.’ And in the same way the universal \n",
      "historians sometimes, when it pleases them and fits in \n",
      "with their theory, say that pow er is the result of events, \n",
      "and sometimes, when they want to prove something else, \n",
      "say that power produces events. \n",
